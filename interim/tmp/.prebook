She lay curled\nup on the sofa in the back drawing-room in Harley Street, looking very\nlovely in her white muslin and blue ribbons. If Titania had ever been\ndressed in white muslin and blue ribbons, and had fallen asleep on a\ncrimson damask sofa in a back drawing-room, Edith might have been taken\nfor her. Margaret was struck afresh by her cousin's beauty. They had\ngrown up together from childhood, and all along Edith had been remarked\nupon by every one, except Margaret, for her prettiness; but Margaret had\nnever thought about it until the last few days, when the prospect of\nsoon losing her companion seemed to give force to every sweet quality\nand charm which Edith possessed. They had been talking about wedding\ndresses, and wedding ceremonies; and Captain Lennox, and what he had\ntold Edith about her future life at Corfu, where his regiment was\nstationed; and the difficulty of keeping a piano in good tune (a\ndifficulty which Edith seemed to consider as one of the most formidable\nthat could befall her in her married life), and what gowns she should\nwant in the visits to Scotland, which would immediately succeed her\nmarriage; but the whispered tone had latterly become more drowsy; and\nMargaret, after a pause of a few minutes, found, as she fancied, that in\nspite of the buzz in the next room, Edith had rolled herself up into a\nsoft ball of muslin and ribbon, and silken curls, and gone off into a\npeaceful little after-dinner nap."

But in default of\na listener, she had to brood over the change in her life silently as\nheretofore. It was a happy brooding, although tinged with regret at\nbeing separated for an indefinite time from her gentle aunt and dear\ncousin. As she thought of the delight of filling the important post of\nonly daughter in Helstone parsonage, pieces of the conversation out of\nthe next room came upon her ears. Her aunt Shaw was talking to the five\nor six ladies who had been dining there, and whose husbands were still\nin the dining-room. They were the familiar acquaintances of the house;\nneighbours whom Mrs. Shaw called friends, because she happened to dine\nwith them more frequently than with any other people, and because if she\nor Edith wanted anything from them, or they from her, they did not\nscruple to make a call at each other's houses before luncheon. These\nladies and their husbands were invited, in their capacity of friends, to\neat a farewell dinner in honour of Edith's approaching marriage. Edith\nhad rather objected to this arrangement, for Captain Lennox was expected\nto arrive by a late train this very evening; but, although she was a\nspoiled child, she was too careless and idle to have a very strong will\nof her own, and gave way when she found that her mother had absolutely\nordered those extra delicacies of the season which are always supposed\nto be efficacious against immoderate grief at farewell dinners. She\ncontented herself by leaning back in her chair, merely playing with the\nfood on her plate, and looking grave and absent; while all around her\nwere enjoying the mots of Mr. Grey, the gentleman who always took the\nbottom of the table at Mrs. Shaw's dinner parties, and asked Edith to\ngive them some music in the drawing-room. Mr. Grey was particularly\nagreeable over this farewell dinner, and the gentlemen staid down stairs\nlonger than usual. It was very well they did—to judge from the\nfragments of conversation which Margaret overheard."

Of course, without any\nmaternal partiality, I foresaw that the dear child was likely to marry\nearly; indeed, I had often said that I was sure she would be married\nbefore she was nineteen. I had quite a prophetic feeling when Captain\nLennox'—and here the voice dropped into a whisper, but Margaret could\neasily supply the blank. The course of true love in Edith's case had run\nremarkably smooth. Mrs. Shaw had given way to the presentiment, as she\nexpressed it; and had rather urged on the marriage, although it was\nbelow the expectations which many of Edith's acquaintances had formed\nfor her, a young and pretty heiress. But Mrs. Shaw said that her only\nchild should marry for love,—and sighed emphatically, as if love had\nnot been her motive for marrying the General. Mrs. Shaw enjoyed the\nromance of the present engagement rather more than her daughter. Not but\nthat Edith was very thoroughly and properly in love; still she would\ncertainly have preferred a good house in Belgravia, to all the\npicturesqueness of the life which Captain Lennox described at Corfu. The\nvery parts which made Margaret glow as she listened, Edith pretended to\nshiver and shudder at; partly for the pleasure she had in being coaxed\nout of her dislike by her fond lover, and partly because anything of a\ngipsy or make-shift life was really distasteful to her. Yet had any one\ncome with a fine house, and a fine estate, and a fine title to boot,\nEdith would still have clung to Captain Lennox while the temptation\nlasted; when it was over, it is possible she might have had little\nqualms of ill-concealed regret that Captain Lennox could not have united\nin his person everything that was desirable. In this she was but her\nmother's child; who, after deliberately marrying General Shaw with no\nwarmer feeling than respect for his character and establishment, was\nconstantly, though quietly, bemoaning her hard lot in being united to\none whom she could not love."

She remembered the dark, dim look of\nthe London nursery, presided over by an austere and ceremonious nurse,\nwho was terribly particular about clean hands and torn frocks. She\nrecollected the first tea up there—separate from her father and aunt,\nwho were dining somewhere down below an infinite depth of stairs; for\nunless she were up in the sky (the child thought), they must be deep\ndown in the bowels of the earth. At home—before she came to live in\nHarley Street—her mother's dressing-room had been her nursery; and, as\nthey kept early hours in the country parsonage, Margaret had always had\nher meals with her father and mother. Oh! well did the tall stately girl\nof eighteen remember the tears shed with such wild passion of grief by\nthe little girl of nine, as she hid her face under the bed-clothes, in\nthat first night; and how she was bidden not to cry by the nurse,\nbecause it would disturb Miss Edith; and how she had cried as bitterly,\nbut more quietly, till her newly-seen, grand, pretty aunt had come\nsoftly upstairs with Mr. Hale to show him his little sleeping daughter.\nThen the little Margaret had hushed her sobs, and tried to lie quiet as\nif asleep, for fear of making her father unhappy by her grief, which she\ndared not express before her aunt, and which she rather thought it was\nwrong to feel at all after the long hoping, and planning, and contriving\nthey had gone through at home, before her wardrobe could be arranged so\nas to suit her grander circumstances, and before papa could leave his\nparish to come up to London, even for a few days."

Margaret stood right under the\nchandelier, quite silent and passive, while her aunt adjusted the\ndraperies. Occasionally, as she was turned round, she caught a glimpse\nof herself in the mirror over the chimney-piece, and smiled at her own\nappearance there—the familiar features in the usual garb of a princess.\nShe touched the shawls gently as they hung around her, and took a\npleasure in their soft feel and their brilliant colours, and rather\nliked to be dressed in such splendour—enjoying it much as a child would\ndo, with a quiet pleased smile on her lips. Just then the door opened,\nand Mr. Henry Lennox was suddenly announced. Some of the ladies started\nback, as if half-ashamed of their feminine interest in dress. Mrs. Shaw\nheld out her hand to the new-comer; Margaret stood perfectly still,\nthinking she might be yet wanted as a sort of block for the shawls; but\nlooking at Mr. Lennox with a bright, amused face, as if sure of his\nsympathy in her sense of the ludicrousness at being thus surprised."

Almost immediately, Edith came in from the\nback drawing-room, winking and blinking her eyes at the stronger light,\nshaking back her slightly-ruffled curls, and altogether looking like the\nSleeping Beauty just startled from her dreams. Even in her slumber she\nhad instinctively felt that a Lennox was worth rousing herself for; and\nshe had a multitude of questions to ask about dear Janet, the future,\nunseen sister-in-law, for whom she professed so much affection, that if\nMargaret had not been very proud she might have almost felt jealous of\nthe mushroom rival. As Margaret sank rather more into the background on\nher aunt's joining the conversation, she saw Henry Lennox directing his\nlook towards a vacant seat near her; and she knew perfectly well that as\nsoon as Edith released him from her questioning, he would take\npossession of that chair. She had not been quite sure, from her aunt's\nrather confused account of his engagements, whether he would come that\nnight; it was almost a surprise to see him; and now she was sure of a\npleasant evening. He liked and disliked pretty nearly the same things\nthat she did. Margaret's face was lightened up into an honest, open\nbrightness. By-and-by he came.

Her mother\nhad been detained at home by a multitude of half-reasons, none of which\nanybody fully understood, except Mr. Hale, who was perfectly aware that\nall his arguments in favour of a grey satin gown, which was midway\nbetween oldness and newness, had proved unavailing; and that, as he had\nnot the money to equip his wife afresh, from top to toe, she would not\nshow herself at her only sister's only child's wedding. If Mrs. Shaw had\nguessed at the real reason why Mrs. Hale did not accompany her husband,\nshe would have showered down gowns upon her; but it was nearly twenty\nyears since Mrs. Shaw had been the poor, pretty Miss Beresford, and she\nhad really forgotten all grievances except that of the unhappiness\narising from disparity of age in married life, on which she could\ndescant by the half-hour. Dearest Maria had married the man of her\nheart, only eight years older than herself, with the sweetest temper,\nand that blue-black hair one so seldom sees. Mr. Hale was one of the\nmost delightful preachers she had ever heard, and a perfect model of a\nparish priest. Perhaps it was not quite a logical deduction from all\nthese premises, but it was still Mrs. Shaw's characteristic conclusion,\nas she thought over her sister's lot: 'Married for love, what can\ndearest Maria have to wish for in this world?' Mrs. Hale, if she spoke\ntruth, might have answered with a ready-made list, 'a silver-grey glace\nsilk, a white chip bonnet, oh! dozens of things for the wedding, and\nhundreds of things for the house.'"

Her mind and\nbody ached now with the recollection of all she had done and said within\nthe last forty-eight hours. The farewells so hurriedly taken, amongst\nall the other good-byes, of those she had lived with so long, oppressed\nher now with a sad regret for the times that were no more; it did not\nsignify what those times had been, they were gone never to return.\nMargaret's heart felt more heavy than she could ever have thought it\npossible in going to her own dear home, the place and the life she had\nlonged for for years—at that time of all times for yearning and\nlonging, just before the sharp senses lose their outlines in sleep. She\ntook her mind away with a wrench from the recollection of the past to\nthe bright serene contemplation of the hopeful future. Her eyes began to\nsee, not visions of what had been, but the sight actually before her;\nher dear father leaning back asleep in the railway carriage. His\nblue-black hair was grey now, and lay thinly over his brows. The bones\nof his face were plainly to be seen—too plainly for beauty, if his\nfeatures had been less finely cut; as it was, they had a grace if not a\ncomeliness of their own. The face was in repose; but it was rather rest\nafter weariness, than the serene calm of the countenance of one who led\na placid, contented life. Margaret was painfully struck by the worn,\nanxious expression; and she went back over the open and avowed\ncircumstances of her father's life, to find the cause for the lines that\nspoke so plainly of habitual distress and depression."

But he had the same large, soft eyes\nas his daughter,—eyes which moved slowly and almost grandly round in\ntheir orbits, and were well veiled by their transparent white eyelids.\nMargaret was more like him than like her mother. Sometimes people\nwondered that parents so handsome should have a daughter who was so far\nfrom regularly beautiful; not beautiful at all, was occasionally said.\nHer mouth was wide; no rosebud that could only open just enough to let\nout a 'yes' and 'no,' and 'an't please you, sir.'

The forest\ntrees were all one dark, full, dusky green; the fern below them caught\nall the slanting sunbeams; the weather was sultry and broodingly still.\nMargaret used to tramp along by her father's side, crushing down the\nfern with a cruel glee, as she felt it yield under her light foot, and\nsend up the fragrance peculiar to it,—out on the broad commons into the\nwarm scented light, seeing multitudes of wild, free, living creatures,\nrevelling in the sunshine, and the herbs and flowers it called forth.\nThis life—at least these walks—realised all Margaret's anticipations.\nShe took a pride in her forest. Its people were her people. She made\nhearty friends with them; learned and delighted in using their peculiar\nwords; took up her freedom amongst them; nursed their babies; talked or\nread with slow distinctness to their old people; carried dainty messes\nto their sick; resolved before long to teach at the school, where her\nfather went every day as to an appointed task, but she was continually\ntempted off to go and see some individual friend—man, woman, or\nchild—in some cottage in the green shade of the forest. Her\nout-of-doors life was perfect. Her in-doors life had its drawbacks. With\nthe healthy shame of a child, she blamed herself for her keenness of\nsight, in perceiving that all was not as it should be there. Her\nmother—her mother always so kind and tender towards her—seemed now and\nthen so much discontented with their situation; thought that the bishop\nstrangely neglected his episcopal duties, in not giving Mr. Hale a\nbetter living; and almost reproached her husband because he could not\nbring himself to say that he wished to leave the parish, and undertake\nthe charge of a larger. He would sigh aloud as he answered, that if he\ncould do what he ought in little Helstone, he should be thankful; but\nevery day he was more overpowered; the world became more bewildering. At\neach repeated urgency of his wife, that he would put himself in the way\nof seeking some preferment, Margaret saw that her father shrank more and\nmore; and she strove at such times to reconcile her mother to Helstone.\nMrs. Hale said that the near neighbourhood of so many trees affected her\nhealth; and Margaret would try to tempt her forth on to the beautiful,\nbroad, upland, sun-streaked, cloud-shadowed common; for she was sure\nthat her mother had accustomed herself too much to an in-doors life,\nseldom extending her walks beyond the church, the school, and the\nneighbouring cottages. This did good for a time; but when the autumn\ndrew on, and the weather became more changeable, her mother's idea of\nthe unhealthiness of the place increased; and she repined even more\nfrequently that her husband, who was more learned than Mr. Hume, a\nbetter parish priest than Mr. Houldsworth, should not have met with the\npreferment that these two former neighbours of theirs had done."

Her keen\nenjoyment of every sensuous pleasure, was balanced finely, if not\noverbalanced, by her conscious pride in being able to do without them\nall, if need were. But the cloud never comes in that quarter of the\nhorizon from which we watch for it.

But the evenings were\nrather difficult to fill up agreeably.

At one time they had tried backgammon as\na resource; but as Mr. Hale grew to take an increasing interest in his\nschool and his parishioners, he found that the interruptions which arose\nout of these duties were regarded as hardships by his wife, not to be\naccepted as the natural conditions of his profession, but to be\nregretted and struggled against by her as they severally arose.

Now there were only the well-bound\nlittle-read English Classics, which were weeded out of her father's\nlibrary to fill up the small book-shelves in the drawing-room. Thomson's\nSeasons, Hayley's Cowper, Middleton's Cicero, were by far the lightest,\nnewest, and most amusing. The book-shelves did not afford much resource.\nMargaret told her mother every particular of her London life, to all of\nwhich Mrs. Hale listened with interest, sometimes amused and\nquestioning, at others a little inclined to compare her sister's\ncircumstances of ease and comfort with the narrower means at Helstone\nvicarage. On such evenings Margaret was apt to stop talking rather\nabruptly, and listen to the drip-drip of the rain upon the leads of the\nlittle bow-window. Once or twice Margaret found herself mechanically\ncounting the repetition of the monotonous sound, while she wondered if\nshe might venture to put a question on a subject very near to her heart,\nand ask where Frederick was now; what he was doing; how long it was\nsince they had heard from him. But a consciousness that her mother's\ndelicate health, and positive dislike to Helstone, all dated from the\ntime of the mutiny in which Frederick had been engaged,—the full\naccount of which Margaret had never heard, and which now seemed doomed\nto be buried in sad oblivion,—made her pause and turn away from the\nsubject each time she approached it. When she was with her mother, her\nfather seemed the best person to apply to for information; and when with\nhim, she thought that she could speak more easily to her mother.\nProbably there was nothing much to be heard that was new. In one of the\nletters she had received before leaving Harley Street, her father had\ntold her that they had heard from Frederick; he was still at Rio, and\nvery well in health, and sent his best love to her; which was dry bones,\nbut not the living intelligence she longed for. Frederick was always\nspoken of, in the rare times when his name was mentioned, as 'Poor\nFrederick.' His room was kept exactly as he had left it; and was\nregularly dusted, and put into order by Dixon, Mrs. Hale's maid, who\ntouched no other part of the household work, but always remembered the\nday when she had been engaged by Lady Beresford as ladies' maid to Sir\nJohn's wards, the pretty Miss Beresfords, the belles of Rutlandshire.\nDixon had always considered Mr. Hale as the blight which had fallen upon\nher young lady's prospects in life. If Miss Beresford had not been in\nsuch a hurry to marry a poor country clergyman, there was no knowing\nwhat she might not have become. But Dixon was too loyal to desert her in\nher affliction and downfall (alias her married life). She remained with\nher, and was devoted to her interests; always considering herself as the\ngood and protecting fairy, whose duty it was to baffle the malignant\ngiant, Mr. Hale. Master Frederick had been her favorite and pride; and\nit was with a little softening of her dignified look and manner, that\nshe went in weekly to arrange the chamber as carefully as if he might be\ncoming home that very evening."

He would be\ndepressed for many days after witnessing a death-bed, or hearing of any\ncrime. But now Margaret noticed an absence of mind, as if his thoughts\nwere pre-occupied by some subject, the oppression of which could not be\nrelieved by any daily action, such as comforting the survivors, or\nteaching at the school in hope of lessening the evils in the generation\nto come. Mr. Hale did not go out among his parishioners as much as\nusual; he was more shut up in his study; was anxious for the village\npostman, whose summons to the house-hold was a rap on the back-kitchen\nwindow-shutter—a signal which at one time had often to be repeated\nbefore any one was sufficiently alive to the hour of the day to\nunderstand what it was, and attend to him. Now Mr. Hale loitered about\nthe garden if the morning was fine, and if not, stood dreamily by the\nstudy window until the postman had called, or gone down the lane, giving\na half-respectful, half-confidential shake of the head to the parson,\nwho watched him away beyond the sweet-briar hedge, and past the great\narbutus, before he turned into the room to begin his day's work, with\nall the signs of a heavy heart and an occupied mind."

Even the\npretty lawn at the side of the house was made unsightly and untidy by\nthe straw that had been wafted upon it through the open door and\nwindows. The rooms had a strange echoing sound in them,—and the light\ncame harshly and strongly in through the uncurtained windows,—seeming\nalready unfamiliar and strange. Mrs. Hale's dressing-room was left\nuntouched to the last; and there she and Dixon were packing up clothes,\nand interrupting each other every now and then to exclaim at, and turn\nover with fond regard, some forgotten treasure, in the shape of some\nrelic of the children while they were yet little. They did not make much\nprogress with their work. Down-stairs, Margaret stood calm and\ncollected, ready to counsel or advise the men who had been called in to\nhelp the cook and Charlotte. These two last, crying between whiles,\nwondered how the young lady could keep up so this last day, and settled\nit between them that she was not likely to care much for Helstone,\nhaving been so long in London. There she stood, very pale and quiet,\nwith her large grave eyes observing everything,—up to every present\ncircumstance, however small. They could not understand how her heart was\naching all the time, with a heavy pressure that no sighs could lift off\nor relieve, and how constant exertion for her perceptive faculties was\nthe only way to keep herself from crying out with pain. Moreover, if she\ngave way, who was to act? Her father was examining papers, books,\nregisters, what not, in the vestry with the clerk; and when he came in,\nthere were his own books to pack up, which no one but himself could do\nto his satisfaction.

But at last the four packers went into the kitchen to their tea;\nand Margaret moved stiffly and slowly away from the place in the hall\nwhere she had been standing so long, out through the bare echoing\ndrawing-room, into the twilight of an early November evening. There was\na filmy veil of soft dull mist obscuring, but not hiding, all objects,\ngiving them a lilac hue, for the sun had not yet fully set; a robin was\nsinging,—perhaps, Margaret thought, the very robin that her father had\nso often talked of as his winter pet, and for which he had made, with\nhis own hands, a kind of robin-house by his study-window. The leaves\nwere more gorgeous than ever; the first touch of frost would lay them\nall low on the ground.

Her\neyes were on that late-blowing rose as she was trying to answer; and she\nhad caught the idea of the vivid beauty of the feathery leaves of the\ncarrots in the very middle of his last sentence. Only a fortnight ago!\nAnd all so changed! Where was he now? In London,—going through the old\nround; dining with the old Harley Street set, or with gayer young\nfriends of his own. Even now, while she walked sadly through that damp\nand drear garden in the dusk, with everything falling and fading, and\nturning to decay around her, he might be gladly putting away his\nlaw-books after a day of satisfactory toil, and freshening himself up,\nas he had told her he often did, by a run in the Temple Gardens, taking\nin the while the grand inarticulate mighty roar of tens of thousands of\nbusy men, nigh at hand, but not seen, and catching ever, at his quick\nturns, glimpses of the lights of the city coming up out of the depths of\nthe river. He had often spoken to Margaret of these hasty walks,\nsnatched in the intervals between study and dinner. At his best times\nand in his best moods had he spoken of them; and the thought of them had\nstruck upon her fancy. Here there was no sound. The robin had gone away\ninto the vast stillness of night. Now and then, a cottage door in the\ndistance was opened and shut, as if to admit the tired labourer to his\nhome; but that sounded very far away. A stealthy, creeping, cranching\nsound among the crisp fallen leaves of the forest, beyond the garden,\nseemed almost close at hand. Margaret knew it was some poacher. Sitting\nup in her bed-room this past autumn, with the light of her candle\nextinguished, and purely revelling in the solemn beauty of the heavens\nand the earth, she had many a time seen the light noiseless leap of the\npoachers over the garden-fence, their quick tramp across the dewy\nmoonlit lawn, their disappearance in the black still shadow beyond. The\nwild adventurous freedom of their life had taken her fancy; she felt\ninclined to wish them success; she had no fear of them. But to-night she\nwas afraid, she knew not why. She heard Charlotte shutting the windows,\nand fastening up for the night, unconscious that any one had gone out\ninto the garden. A small branch—it might be of rotten wood, or it might\nbe broken by force—came heavily down in the nearest part of the forest,\nMargaret ran, swift as Camilla, down to the window, and rapped at it\nwith a hurried tremulousness which startled Charlotte within."

Yet within a mile, Margaret knew of house after house, where\nshe for her own sake, and her mother for her aunt Shaw's, would be\nwelcomed, if they came in gladness, or even in peace of mind. If they\ncame sorrowing, and wanting sympathy in a complicated trouble like the\npresent, then they would be felt as a shadow in all these houses of\nintimate acquaintances, not friends.

Heston itself\nwas one long straggling street, running parallel to the seashore. It had\na character of its own, as different from the little bathing-places in\nthe south of England as they again from those of the continent. To use a\nScotch word, every thing looked more 'purposelike.' The country carts\nhad more iron, and less wood and leather about the horse-gear; the\npeople in the streets, although on pleasure bent, had yet a busy mind.\nThe colours looked grayer—more enduring, not so gay and pretty. There\nwere no smock-frocks, even among the country folk; they retarded motion,\nand were apt to catch on machinery, and so the habit of wearing them had\ndied out. In such towns in the south of England, Margaret had seen the\nshopmen, when not employed in their business, lounging a little at their\ndoors, enjoying the fresh air, and the look up and down the street.\nHere, if they had any leisure from customers, they made themselves\nbusiness in the shop—even, Margaret fancied, to the unnecessary\nunrolling and rerolling of ribbons. All these differences struck upon\nher mind, as she and her mother went out next morning to look for\nlodgings."

The\ndistant sea, lapping the sandy shore with measured sound; the nearer\ncries of the donkey-boys; the unusual scenes moving before her like\npictures, which she cared not in her laziness to have fully explained\nbefore they passed away; the stroll down to the beach to breathe the\nsea-air, soft and warm on that sandy shore even to the end of November;\nthe great long misty sea-line touching the tender-coloured sky; the\nwhite sail of a distant boat turning silver in some pale sunbeam:—it\nseemed as if she could dream her life away in such luxury of\npensiveness, in which she made her present all in all, from not daring\nto think of the past, or wishing to contemplate the future."

Nearer to the town, the air had a faint taste and smell of smoke;\nperhaps, after all, more a loss of the fragrance of grass and herbage\nthan any positive taste or smell. Quick they were whirled over long,\nstraight, hopeless streets of regularly-built houses, all small and of\nbrick. Here and there a great oblong many-windowed factory stood up,\nlike a hen among her chickens, puffing out black 'unparliamentary'\nsmoke, and sufficiently accounting for the cloud which Margaret had\ntaken to foretell rain. As they drove through the larger and wider\nstreets, from the station to the hotel, they had to stop constantly;\ngreat loaded lorries blocked up the not over-wide thoroughfares.\nMargaret had now and then been into the city in her drives with her\naunt. But there the heavy lumbering vehicles seemed various in their\npurposes and intent; here every van, every waggon and truck, bore\ncotton, either in the raw shape in bags, or the woven shape in bales of\ncalico. People thronged the footpaths, most of them well-dressed as\nregarded the material, but with a slovenly looseness which struck\nMargaret as different from the shabby, threadbare smartness of a similar\nclass in London."

The recollection\nof the plentiful luxury of all the arrangements, the stately\nhandsomeness of the furniture, the size of the house, the peaceful,\nuntroubled ease of the visitors—all came vividly before her, in strange\ncontrast to the present time. The smooth sea of that old life closed up,\nwithout a mark left to tell where they had all been. The habitual\ndinners, the calls, the shopping, the dancing evenings, were all going\non, going on for ever, though her Aunt Shaw and Edith were no longer\nthere; and she, of course, was even less missed. She doubted if any one\nof that old set ever thought of her, except Henry Lennox. He too, she\nknew, would strive to forget her, because of the pain she had caused\nhim. She had heard him often boast of his power of putting any\ndisagreeable thought far away from him. Then she penetrated farther into\nwhat might have been. If she had cared for him as a lover, and had\naccepted him, and this change in her father's opinions and consequent\nstation had taken place, she could not doubt but that it would have been\nimpatiently received by Mr. Lennox. It was a bitter mortification to her\nin one sense; but she could bear it patiently, because she knew her\nfather's purity of purpose, and that strengthened her to endure his\nerrors, grave and serious though in her estimation they were. But the\nfact of the world esteeming her father degraded, in its rough wholesale\njudgment, would have oppressed and irritated Mr. Lennox. As she realised\nwhat might have been, she grew to be thankful for what was. They were at\nthe lowest now; they could not be worse. Edith's astonishment and her\naunt Shaw's dismay would have to be met bravely, when their letters\ncame. So Margaret rose up and began slowly to undress herself, feeling\nthe full luxury of acting leisurely, late as it was, after all the past\nhurry of the day. She fell asleep, hoping for some brightness, either\ninternal or external. But if she had known how long it would be before\nthe brightness came, her heart would have sunk low down. The time of the\nyear was most unpropitious to health as well as to spirits. Her mother\ncaught a severe cold, and Dixon herself was evidently not well, although\nMargaret could not insult her more than by trying to save her, or by\ntaking any care of her. They could hear of no girl to assist her; all\nwere at work in the factories; at least, those who applied were well\nscolded by Dixon, for thinking that such as they could ever be trusted\nto work in a gentleman's house. So they had to keep a charwoman in\nalmost constant employ. Margaret longed to send for Charlotte; but\nbesides the objection of her being a better servant than they could now\nafford to keep, the distance was too great."

They were mostly of the\nage when many boys would be still at school, but, according to the\nprevalent, and apparently well-founded notions of Milton, to make a lad\ninto a good tradesman he must be caught young, and acclimated to the\nlife of the mill, or office, or warehouse. If he were sent to even the\nScotch Universities, he came back unsettled for commercial pursuits; how\nmuch more so if he went to Oxford or Cambridge, where he could not be\nentered till he was eighteen? So most of the manufacturers placed their\nsons in sucking situations' at fourteen or fifteen years of age,\nunsparingly cutting away all off-shoots in the direction of literature\nor high mental cultivation, in hopes of throwing the whole strength and\nvigour of the plant into commerce. Still there were some wiser parents;\nand some young men, who had sense enough to perceive their own\ndeficiencies, and strive to remedy them. Nay, there were a few no longer\nyouths, but men in the prime of life, who had the stern wisdom to\nacknowledge their own ignorance, and to learn late what they should have\nlearnt early. Mr. Thornton was perhaps the oldest of Mr. Hale's pupils.\nHe was certainly the favourite. Mr. Hale got into the habit of quoting\nhis opinions so frequently, and with such regard, that it became a\nlittle domestic joke to wonder what time, during the hour appointed for\ninstruction, could be given to absolute learning, so much of it appeared\nto have been spent in conversation."

But Margaret went less abroad, among machinery and men; saw\nless of power in its public effect, and, as it happened, she was thrown\nwith one or two of those who, in all measures affecting masses of\npeople, must be acute sufferers for the good of many. The question\nalways is, has everything been done to make the sufferings of these\nexceptions as small as possible?

But Dixon's ideas of helpful girls\nwere founded on the recollection of tidy elder scholars at Helstone\nschool, who were only too proud to be allowed to come to the parsonage\non a busy day, and treated Mrs. Dixon with all the respect, and a good\ndeal more of fright, which they paid to Mr. and Mrs. Hale. Dixon was not\nunconscious of this awed reverence which was given to her; nor did she\ndislike it; it flattered her much as Louis the Fourteenth was flattered\nby his courtiers shading their eyes from the dazzling light of his\npresence. But nothing short of her faithful love for Mrs. Hale could\nhave made her endure the rough independent way in which all the Milton\ngirls, who made application for the servant's place, replied to her\ninquiries respecting their qualifications. They even went the length of\nquestioning her back again; having doubts and fears of their own, as to\nthe solvency of a family who lived in a house of thirty pounds a-year,\nand yet gave themselves airs, and kept two servants, one of them so very\nhigh and mighty. Mr. Hale was no longer looked upon as Vicar of\nHelstone, but as a man who only spent at a certain rate. Margaret was\nweary and impatient of the accounts which Dixon perpetually brought to\nMrs. Hale of the behaviour of these would-be servants. Not but what\nMargaret was repelled by the rough uncourteous manners of these people;\nnot but what she shrunk with fastidious pride from their hail-fellow\naccost and severely resented their unconcealed curiosity as to the means\nand position of any family who lived in Milton, and yet were not engaged\nin trade of some kind. But the more Margaret felt impertinence, the more\nlikely she was to be silent on the subject; and, at any rate, if she\ntook upon herself to make inquiry for a servant, she could spare her\nmother the recital of all her disappointments and fancied or real\ninsults."

It was something of a trial to\nMargaret to go out by herself in this busy bustling place. Mrs. Shaw's\nideas of propriety and her own helpless dependence on others, had always\nmade her insist that a footman should accompany Edith and Margaret, if\nthey went beyond Harley Street or the immediate neighbourhood. The\nlimits by which this rule of her aunt's had circumscribed Margaret's\nindependence had been silently rebelled against at the time: and she had\ndoubly enjoyed the free walks and rambles of her forest life, from the\ncontrast which they presented. She went along there with a bounding\nfearless step, that occasionally broke out into a run, if she were in a\nhurry, and occasionally was stilled into perfect repose, as she stood\nlistening to, or watching any of the wild creatures who sang in the\nleafy courts, or glanced out with their keen bright eyes from the low\nbrushwood or tangled furze. It was a trial to come down from such motion\nor such stillness, only guided by her own sweet will, to the even and\ndecorous pace necessary in streets. But she could have laughed at\nherself for minding this change, if it had not been accompanied by what\nwas a more serious annoyance. The side of the town on which Crampton lay\nwas especially a thoroughfare for the factory people. In the back\nstreets around them there were many mills, out of which poured streams\nof men and women two or three times a day. Until Margaret had learnt the\ntimes of their ingress and egress, she was very unfortunate in\nconstantly falling in with them. They came rushing along, with bold,\nfearless faces, and loud laughs and jests, particularly aimed at all\nthose who appeared to be above them in rank or station. The tones of\ntheir unrestrained voices, and their carelessness of all common rules of\nstreet politeness, frightened Margaret a little at first. The girls,\nwith their rough, but not unfriendly freedom, would comment on her\ndress, even touch her shawl or gown to ascertain the exact material;\nnay, once or twice she was asked questions relative to some article\nwhich they particularly admired. There was such a simple reliance on her\nwomanly sympathy with their love of dress, and on her kindliness, that\nshe gladly replied to these inquiries, as soon as she understood them;\nand half smiled back at their remarks. She did not mind meeting any\nnumber of girls, loud spoken and boisterous though they might be. But\nshe alternately dreaded and fired up against the workmen, who commented\nnot on her dress, but on her looks, in the same open fearless manner.\nShe, who had hitherto felt that even the most refined remark on her\npersonal appearance was an impertinence, had to endure undisguised\nadmiration from these outspoken men. But the very out-spokenness marked\ntheir innocence of any intention to hurt her delicacy, as she would have\nperceived if she had been less frightened by the disorderly tumult. Out\nof her fright came a flash of indignation which made her face scarlet,\nand her dark eyes gather flame, as she heard some of their speeches. Yet\nthere were other sayings of theirs, which, when she reached the quiet\nsafety of home, amused her even while they irritated her."

This man looked so careworn that\nMargaret could not help giving him an answering smile, glad to think\nthat her looks, such as they were, should have had the power to call up\na pleasant thought.

He was anxious\nnot to slight his new friend by any disrespectful unpunctuality. The\nchurch-clock struck half-past seven as he stood at the door awaiting\nDixon's slow movements; always doubly tardy when she had to degrade\nherself by answering the door-bell. He was ushered into the little\ndrawing-room, and kindly greeted by Mr. Hale, who led him up to his\nwife, whose pale face, and shawl-draped figure made a silent excuse for\nthe cold languor of her greeting. Margaret was lighting the lamp when he\nentered, for the darkness was coming on. The lamp threw a pretty light\ninto the centre of the dusky room, from which, with country habits, they\ndid not exclude the night-skies, and the outer darkness of air. Somehow,\nthat room contrasted itself with the one he had lately left; handsome,\nponderous, with no sign of feminine habitation, except in the one spot\nwhere his mother sate, and no convenience for any other employment than\neating and drinking. To be sure, it was a dining-room; his mother\npreferred to sit in it; and her will was a household law. But the\ndrawing-room was not like this. It was twice—twenty times as fine; not\none quarter as comfortable. Here were no mirrors, not even a scrap of\nglass to reflect the light, and answer the same purpose as water in a\nlandscape; no gilding; a warm, sober breadth of colouring, well relieved\nby the dear old Helstone chintz-curtains and chair covers. An open\ndavenport stood in the window opposite the door; in the other there was\na stand, with a tall white china vase, from which drooped wreaths of\nEnglish ivy, pale-green birch, and copper-coloured beech-leaves. Pretty\nbaskets of work stood about in different places: and books, not cared\nfor on account of their binding solely, lay on one table, as if recently\nput down. Behind the door was another table, decked out for tea, with a\nwhite tablecloth, on which flourished the cocoa-nut cakes, and a basket\npiled with oranges and ruddy American apples, heaped on leaves."

She stood by the\ntea-table in a light-coloured muslin gown, which had a good deal of pink\nabout it. She looked as if she was not attending to the conversation,\nbut solely busy with the tea-cups, among which her round ivory hands\nmoved with pretty, noiseless, daintiness. She had a bracelet on one\ntaper arm, which would fall down over her round wrist. Mr. Thornton\nwatched the replacing of this troublesome ornament with far more\nattention than he listened to her father. It seemed as if it fascinated\nhim to see her push it up impatiently, until it tightened her soft\nflesh; and then to mark the loosening—the fall. He could almost have\nexclaimed—'There it goes, again!' There was so little left to be done\nafter he arrived at the preparation for tea, that he was almost sorry\nthe obligation of eating and drinking came so soon to prevent his\nwatching Margaret. She handed him his cup of tea with the proud air of\nan unwilling slave; but her eye caught the moment when he was ready for\nanother cup; and he almost longed to ask her to do for him what he saw\nher compelled to do for her father, who took her little finger and thumb\nin his masculine hand, and made them serve as sugar-tongs. Mr. Thornton\nsaw her beautiful eyes lifted to her father, full of light,\nhalf-laughter and half-love, as this bit of pantomime went on between\nthe two, unobserved, as they fancied, by any. Margaret's head still\nached, as the paleness of her complexion, and her silence might have\ntestified; but she was resolved to throw herself into the breach, if\nthere was any long untoward pause, rather than that her father's friend,\npupil, and guest should have cause to think himself in any way\nneglected. But the conversation went on; and Margaret drew into a\ncorner, near her mother, with her work, after the tea-things were taken\naway; and felt that she might let her thoughts roam, without fear of\nbeing suddenly wanted to fill up a gap."

Her father\nwas of slight figure, which made him appear taller than he really was,\nwhen not contrasted, as at this time, with the tall, massive frame of\nanother. The lines in her father's face were soft and waving, with a\nfrequent undulating kind of trembling movement passing over them,\nshowing every fluctuating emotion; the eyelids were large and arched,\ngiving to the eyes a peculiar languid beauty which was almost feminine.\nThe brows were finely arched, but were, by the very size of the dreamy\nlids, raised to a considerable distance from the eyes. Now, in Mr.\nThornton's face the straight brows fell low over the clear, deep-set\nearnest eyes, which, without being unpleasantly sharp, seemed intent\nenough to penetrate into the very heart and core of what he was looking\nat. The lines in the face were few but firm, as if they were carved in\nmarble, and lay principally about the lips, which were slightly\ncompressed over a set of teeth so faultless and beautiful as to give the\neffect of sudden sunlight when the rare bright smile, coming in an\ninstant and shining out of the eyes, changed the whole look from the\nsevere and resolved expression of a man ready to do and dare everything,\nto the keen honest enjoyment of the moment, which is seldom shown so\nfearlessly and instantaneously except by children. Margaret liked this\nsmile; it was the first thing she had admired in this new friend of her\nfather's; and the opposition of character, shown in all these details of\nappearance she had just been noticing, seemed to explain the attraction\nthey evidently felt towards each other."

Margaret yearned to re-unite the bond of intimate confidence\nwhich had been broken by her long residence at her aunt Shaw's, and\nstrove by gentle caresses and softened words to creep into the warmest\nplace in her mother's heart. But though she received caresses and fond\nwords back again, in such profusion as would have gladdened her\nformerly, yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her, and\nshe believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health. She lay\nawake very long this night, planning how to lessen the evil influence of\ntheir Milton life on her mother. A servant to give Dixon permanent\nassistance should be got, if she gave up her whole time to the search;\nand then, at any rate, her mother might have all the personal attention\nshe required, and had been accustomed to her whole life. Visiting\nregister offices, seeing all manner of unlikely people, and very few in\nthe least likely, absorbed Margaret's time and thoughts for several\ndays. One afternoon she met Bessy Higgins in the street, and stopped to\nspeak to her."

You see, he says that they had many new hands on board the\nRussell, while the Avenger had been nearly three years on the station,\nwith nothing to do but to keep slavers off, and work her men, till they\nran up and down the rigging like rats or monkeys.'"

Some\nsailors being aloft in the main-topsail rigging, the captain had ordered\nthem to race down, threatening the hindmost with the cat-of-nine-tails.\nHe who was the farthest on the spar, feeling the impossibility of\npassing his companions, and yet passionately dreading the disgrace of\nthe flogging, threw himself desperately down to catch a rope\nconsiderably lower, failed, and fell senseless on deck.

Oh, Margaret! how your father and I turned sick\nover that list, when there was no name of Frederick Hale. We thought it\nmust be some mistake; for poor Fred was such a fine fellow, only perhaps\nrather too passionate; and we hoped that the name of Carr, which was in\nthe list, was a misprint for that of Hale—newspapers are so careless.\nAnd towards post-time the next day, papa set off to walk to Southampton\nto get the papers; and I could not stop at home, so I went to meet him.\nHe was very late—much later than I thought he would have been; and I\nsat down under the hedge to wait for him.

The\nlodge-keeper admitted them into a great oblong yard, on one side of\nwhich were offices for the transaction of business; on the opposite, an\nimmense many-windowed mill, whence proceeded the continual clank of\nmachinery and the long groaning roar of the steam-engine, enough to\ndeafen those who lived within the enclosure. Opposite to the wall, along\nwhich the street ran, on one of the narrow sides of the oblong, was a\nhandsome stone-coped house,—blackened, to be sure, by the smoke, but\nwith paint, windows, and steps kept scrupulously clean. It was evidently\na house which had been built some fifty or sixty years. The stone\nfacings—the long, narrow windows, and the number of them—the flights\nof steps up to the front door, ascending from either side, and guarded\nby railing—all witnessed to its age. Margaret only wondered why people\nwho could afford to live in so good a house, and keep it in such perfect\norder, did not prefer a much smaller dwelling in the country, or even\nsome suburb; not in the continual whirl and din of the factory. Her\nunaccustomed ears could hardly catch her father's voice, as they stood\non the steps awaiting the opening of the door. The yard, too, with the\ngreat doors in the dead wall as a boundary, was but a dismal look-out\nfor the sitting-rooms of the house—as Margaret found when they had\nmounted the old-fashioned stairs, and been ushered into the\ndrawing-room, the three windows of which went over the front door and\nthe room on the right-hand side of the entrance. There was no one in the\ndrawing-room. It seemed as though no one had been in it since the day\nwhen the furniture was bagged up with as much care as if the house was\nto be overwhelmed with lava, and discovered a thousand years hence. The\nwalls were pink and gold; the pattern on the carpet represented bunches\nof flowers on a light ground, but it was carefully covered up in the\ncentre by a linen drugget, glazed and colourless. The window-curtains\nwere lace; each chair and sofa had its own particular veil of netting,\nor knitting. Great alabaster groups occupied every flat surface, safe\nfrom dust under their glass shades. In the middle of the room, right\nunder the bagged-up chandelier, was a large circular table, with\nsmartly-bound books arranged at regular intervals round the\ncircumference of its polished surface, like gaily-coloured spokes of a\nwheel. Everything reflected light, nothing absorbed it. The whole room\nhad a painfully spotted, spangled, speckled look about it, which\nimpressed Margaret so unpleasantly that she was hardly conscious of the\npeculiar cleanliness required to keep everything so white and pure in\nsuch an atmosphere, or of the trouble that must be willingly expended to\nsecure that effect of icy, snowy discomfort. Wherever she looked there\nwas evidence of care and labour, but not care and labour to procure\nease, to help on habits of tranquil home employment; solely to ornament,\nand then to preserve ornament from dirt or destruction."

Remembering,\ntoo, the horses to her carriage, hired for her own visit to the Hales,\nand how Fanny had been ordered to go by Mr. Thornton, in order to pay\nevery respect to them, Mrs. Thornton drew up slightly offended, and gave\nMargaret no sympathy—indeed, hardly any credit for the statement of her\nmother's indisposition."

Consequently, she received many\nshort answers. She was not sorry when, at ten o'clock, the servants\nfiled in to prayers. These her mother always read,—first reading a\nchapter. They were now working steadily through the Old Testament. When\nprayers were ended, and his mother had wished him goodnight, with that\nlong steady look of hers which conveyed no expression of the tenderness\nthat was in her heart, but yet had the intensity of a blessing, Mr.\nThornton continued his walk. All his business plans had received a\ncheck, a sudden pull-up, from this approaching turn-out. The forethought\nof many anxious hours was thrown away, utterly wasted by their insane\nfolly, which would injure themselves even more than him, though no one\ncould set any limit to the mischief they were doing. And these were the\nmen who thought themselves fitted to direct the masters in the disposal\nof their capital! Hamper had said, only this very day, that if he were\nruined by the strike, he would start life again, comforted by the\nconviction that those who brought it on were in a worse predicament than\nhe himself,—for he had head as well as hands, while they had only\nhands; and if they drove away their market, they could not follow it,\nnor turn to anything else. But this thought was no consolation to Mr.\nThornton. It might be that revenge gave him no pleasure; it might be\nthat he valued the position he had earned with the sweat of his brow, so\nmuch that he keenly felt its being endangered by the ignorance or folly\nof others,—so keenly that he had no thoughts to spare for what would be\nthe consequences of their conduct to themselves. He paced up and down,\nsetting his teeth a little now and then. At last it struck two. The\ncandles were flickering in their sockets. He lighted his own, muttering\nto himself:"

    "innerHtml": "They needed this gleam of brightness in-doors, for out-of-doors, even to\ntheir uninstructed eyes, there was a gloomy brooding appearance of\ndiscontent. Mr. Hale had his own acquaintances among the working men,\nand was depressed with their earnestly told tales of suffering and\nlong-endurance. They would have scorned to speak of what they had to\nbear to any one who might, from his position, have understood it without\ntheir words. But here was this man, from a distant county, who was\nperplexed by the workings of the system into the midst of which he was\nthrown, and each was eager to make him a judge, and to bring witness of\nhis own causes for irritation. Then Mr. Hale brought all his budget of\ngrievances, and laid it before Mr. Thornton, for him, with his\nexperience as a master, to arrange them, and explain their origin; which\nhe always did, on sound economical principles; showing that, as trade\nwas conducted, there must always be a waxing and waning of commercial\nprosperity; and that in the waning a certain number of masters, as well\nas of men, must go down into ruin, and be no more seen among the ranks\nof the happy and prosperous. He spoke as if this consequence were so\nentirely logical, that neither employers nor employed had any right to\ncomplain if it became their fate: the employer to turn aside from the\nrace he could no longer run, with a bitter sense of incompetency and\nfailure—wounded in the struggle—trampled down by his fellows in their\nhaste to get rich—slighted where he once was honoured—humbly asking\nfor, instead of bestowing, employment with a lordly hand. Of course,\nspeaking so of the fate that, as a master, might be his own in the\nfluctuations of commerce, he was not likely to have more sympathy with\nthat of the workmen, who were passed by in the swift merciless\nimprovement or alteration who would fain lie down and quietly die out of\nthe world that needed them not, but felt as if they could never rest in\ntheir graves for the clinging cries of the beloved and helpless they\nwould leave behind; who envied the power of the wild bird, that can feed\nher young with her very heart's blood. Margaret's whole soul rose up\nagainst him while he reasoned in this way—as if commerce were\neverything and humanity nothing. She could hardly, thank him for the\nindividual kindness, which brought him that very evening to offer\nher—for the delicacy which made him understand that he must offer her\nprivately—every convenience for illness that his own wealth or his\nmother's foresight had caused them to accumulate in their household, and\nwhich, as he learnt from Dr. Donaldson, Mrs. Hale might possibly\nrequire. His presence, after the way he had spoken—his bringing before\nher the doom, which she was vainly trying to persuade herself might yet\nbe averted from her mother—all conspired to set Margaret's teeth on\nedge, as she looked at him, and listened to him. What business had he to\nbe the only person, except Dr. Donaldson and Dixon, admitted to the\nawful secret, which she held shut up in the most dark and sacred recess\nof her heart—not daring to look at it, unless she invoked heavenly\nstrength to bear the sight—that, some day soon, she should cry aloud\nfor her mother, and no answer would come out of the blank, dumb\ndarkness? Yet he knew all. She saw it in his pitying eyes. She heard it\nin his grave and tremulous voice. How reconcile those eyes, that voice,\nwith the hard-reasoning, dry, merciless way in which he laid down axioms\nof trade, and serenely followed them out to their full consequences? The\ndiscord jarred upon her inexpressibly. The more because of the gathering\nwoe of which she heard from Bessy. To be sure, Nicholas Higgins, the\nfather, spoke differently. He had been appointed a committee-man, and\nsaid that he knew secrets of which the exoteric knew nothing. He said\nthis more expressly and particularly, on the very day before Mrs.\nThornton's dinner-party, when Margaret, going in to speak to Bessy,\nfound him arguing the point with Boucher, the neighbour of whom she had\nfrequently heard mention, as by turns exciting Higgins's compassion, as\nan unskilful workman with a large family depending upon him for support,\nand at other times enraging his more energetic and sanguine neighbour by\nhis want of what the latter called spirit. It was very evident that\nHiggins was in a passion when Margaret entered. Boucher stood, with both\nhands on the rather high mantel-piece, swaying himself a little on the\nsupport which his arms, thus placed, gave him, and looking wildly into\nthe fire, with a kind of despair that irritated Higgins, even while it\nwent to his heart. Bessy was rocking herself violently backwards and\nforwards, as was her wont (Margaret knew by this time) when she was\nagitated. Her sister Mary was tying on her bonnet (in great clumsy bows,\nas suited her great clumsy fingers), to go to her fustian-cutting,\nblubbering out loud the while, and evidently longing to be away from a\nscene that distressed her. Margaret came in upon this scene. She stood\nfor a moment at the door—then, her finger on her lips, she stole to a\nseat on the squab near Bessy. Nicholas saw her come in, and greeted her\nwith a gruff, but not unfriendly nod. Mary hurried out of the house\ncatching gladly at the open door, and crying aloud when she got away\nfrom her father's presence. It was only John Boucher that took no notice\nwhatever who came in and who went out."

If I think of it at all, I connect it with my\nson, and feel how all belongs to him, and that his is the head that\ndirects it. Just now, there are no sounds to come from the mill; the\nhands have been ungrateful enough to turn out, as perhaps you have\nheard. But the very business (of which I spoke, when you entered), had\nreference to the steps he is going to take to make them learn their\nplace.' The expression on her face, always stern, deepened into dark\nanger, as she said this. Nor did it clear away when Mr. Thornton entered\nthe room; for she saw, in an instant, the weight of care and anxiety\nwhich he could not shake off, although his guests received from him a\ngreeting that appeared both cheerful and cordial. He shook hands with\nMargaret. He knew it was the first time their hands had met, though she\nwas perfectly unconscious of the fact.

And as he looked with this intention, he was\nstruck anew with her great beauty. He had never seen her in such dress\nbefore and yet now it appeared as if such elegance of attire was so\nbefitting her noble figure and lofty serenity of countenance, that she\nought to go always thus apparelled. She was talking to Fanny; about\nwhat, he could not hear; but he saw his sister's restless way of\ncontinually arranging some part of her gown, her wandering eyes, now\nglancing here, now there, but without any purpose in her observation;\nand he contrasted them uneasily with the large soft eyes that looked\nforth steadily at one object, as if from out their light beamed some\ngentle influence of repose: the curving lines of the red lips, just\nparted in the interest of listening to what her companion said—the head\na little bent forwards, so as to make a long sweeping line from the\nsummit, where the light caught on the glossy raven hair, to the smooth\nivory tip of the shoulder; the round white arms, and taper hands, laid\nlightly across each other, but perfectly motionless in their pretty\nattitude. Mr. Thornton sighed as he took in all this with one of his\nsudden comprehensive glances.

Mr. Thornton felt that in this influx\nno one was speaking to Margaret, and was restless under this apparent\nneglect. But he never went near her himself; he did not look at her.\nOnly, he knew what she was doing—or not doing—better than he knew the\nmovements of any one else in the room. Margaret was so unconscious of\nherself, and so much amused by watching other people, that she never\nthought whether she was left unnoticed or not. Somebody took her down to\ndinner; she did not catch the name; nor did he seem much inclined to\ntalk to her. There was a very animated conversation going on among the\ngentlemen; the ladies, for the most part, were silent, employing\nthemselves in taking notes of the dinner and criticising each other's\ndresses. Margaret caught the clue to the general conversation, grew\ninterested and listened attentively. Mr. Horsfall, the stranger, whose\nvisit to the town was the original germ of the party, was asking\nquestions relative to the trade and manufactures of the place; and the\nrest of the gentlemen—all Milton men,—were giving him answers and\nexplanations. Some dispute arose, which was warmly contested; it was\nreferred to Mr. Thornton, who had hardly spoken before; but who now gave\nan opinion, the grounds of which were so clearly stated that even the\nopponents yielded. Margaret's attention was thus called to her host; his\nwhole manner as master of the house, and entertainer of his friends, was\nso straightforward, yet simple and modest, as to be thoroughly\ndignified. Margaret thought she had never seen him to so much advantage.\nWhen he had come to their house, there had been always something, either\nof over-eagerness or of that kind of vexed annoyance which seemed ready\nto pre-suppose that he was unjustly judged, and yet felt too proud to\ntry and make himself better understood. But now, among his fellows,\nthere was no uncertainty as to his position. He was regarded by them as\na man of great force of character; of power in many ways. There was no\nneed to struggle for their respect. He had it, and he knew it; and the\nsecurity of this gave a fine grand quietness to his voice and ways,\nwhich Margaret had missed before."

She silently took a very\ndecided part in the question they were discussing. At any rate, they\ntalked in desperate earnest,—not in the used-up style that wearied her\nso in the old London parties. She wondered that with all this dwelling\non the manufactures and trade of the place, no allusion was made to the\nstrike then pending. She did not yet know how coolly such things were\ntaken by the masters, as having only one possible end. To be sure, the\nmen were cutting their own throats, as they had done many a time before;\nbut if they would be fools, and put themselves into the hands of a\nrascally set of paid delegates, they must take the consequence. One or\ntwo thought Thornton looked out of spirits; and, of course, he must lose\nby this turn-out. But it was an accident that might happen to themselves\nany day; and Thornton was as good to manage a strike as any one; for he\nwas as iron a chap as any in Milton. The hands had mistaken their man in\ntrying that dodge on him. And they chuckled inwardly at the idea of the\nworkmen's discomfiture and defeat, in their attempt to alter one iota of\nwhat Thornton had decreed. It was rather dull for Margaret after dinner.\nShe was glad when the gentlemen came, not merely because she caught her\nfather's eye to brighten her sleepiness up; but because she could listen\nto something larger and grander than the petty interests which the\nladies had been talking about. She liked the exultation in the sense of\npower which these Milton men had. It might be rather rampant in its\ndisplay, and savour of boasting; but still they seemed to defy the old\nlimits of possibility, in a kind of fine intoxication, caused by the\nrecollection of what had been achieved, and what yet should be. If in\nher cooler moments she might not approve of their spirit in all things,\nstill there was much to admire in their forgetfulness of themselves and\nthe present, in their anticipated triumphs over all inanimate matter at\nsome future time which none of them should live to see.

He advised Mr. Hale to go to bed, and leave\nonly one to watch the slumber, which he hoped would be undisturbed. He\npromised to come again early in the morning. And with a warm and kindly\nshake of the hand, he left them. They spoke but few words; they were too\nmuch exhausted by their terror to do more than decide upon the immediate\ncourse of action. Mr. Hale was resolved to sit up through the night, and\nall that Margaret could do was to prevail upon him to rest on the\ndrawing-room sofa. Dixon stoutly and bluntly refused to go to bed; and,\nas for Margaret, it was simply impossible that she should leave her\nmother, let all the doctors in the world speak of 'husbanding\nresources,' and 'one watcher only being required.' So, Dixon sat, and\nstared, and winked, and drooped, and picked herself up again with a\njerk, and finally gave up the battle, and fairly snored. Margaret had\ntaken off her gown and tossed it aside with a sort of impatient disgust,\nand put on her dressing-gown. She felt as if she never could sleep\nagain; as if her whole senses were acutely vital, and all endued with\ndouble keenness, for the purposes of watching. Every sight and\nsound—nay, even every thought, touched some nerve to the very quick.\nFor more than two hours, she heard her father's restless movements in\nthe next room. He came perpetually to the door of her mother's chamber,\npausing there to listen, till she, not hearing his close unseen\npresence, went and opened it to tell him how all went on, in reply to\nthe questions his baked lips could hardly form. At last he, too, fell\nasleep, and all the house was still. Margaret sate behind the curtain\nthinking. Far away in time, far away in space, seemed all the interests\nof past days. Not more than thirty-six hours ago, she cared for Bessy\nHiggins and her father, and her heart was wrung for Boucher; now, that\nwas all like a dreaming memory of some former life;—everything that had\npassed out of doors seemed dissevered from her mother, and therefore\nunreal. Even Harley Street appeared more distinct; there she remembered,\nas if it were yesterday, how she had pleased herself with tracing out\nher mother's features in her Aunt Shaw's face,—and how letters had\ncome, making her dwell on the thoughts of home with all the longing of\nlove. Helstone, itself, was in the dim past. The dull gray days of the\npreceding winter and spring, so uneventless and monotonous, seemed more\nassociated with what she cared for now above all price. She would fain\nhave caught at the skirts of that departing time, and prayed it to\nreturn, and give her back what she had too little valued while it was\nyet in her possession. What a vain show Life seemed! How unsubstantial,\nand flickering, and flitting! It was as if from some aerial belfry, high\nup above the stir and jar of the earth, there was a bell continually\ntolling, 'All are shadows!—all are passing!—all is past!' And when the\nmorning dawned, cool and gray, like many a happier morning before—when\nMargaret looked one by one at the sleepers, it seemed as if the terrible\nnight were unreal as a dream; it, too, was a shadow. It, too, was past."

An August sun\nbeat straight down into the street at three o'clock in the afternoon.\nMargaret went along, without noticing anything very different from usual\nin the first mile and a half of her journey; she was absorbed in her own\nthoughts, and had learnt by this time to thread her way through the\nirregular stream of human beings that flowed through Milton streets.\nBut, by and by, she was struck with an unusual heaving among the mass of\npeople in the crowded road on which she was entering. They did not\nappear to be moving on, so much as talking, and listening, and buzzing\nwith excitement, without much stirring from the spot where they might\nhappen to be. Still, as they made way for her, and, wrapt up in the\npurpose of her errand, and the necessities that suggested it, she was\nless quick of observation than she might have been, if her mind had been\nat ease, she had got into Marlborough Street before the full conviction\nforced itself upon her, that there was a restless, oppressive sense of\nirritation abroad among the people; a thunderous atmosphere, morally as\nwell as physically, around her. From every narrow lane opening out on\nMarlborough Street came up a low distant roar, as of myriads of fierce\nindignant voices. The inhabitants of each poor squalid dwelling were\ngathered round the doors and windows, if indeed they were not actually\nstanding in the middle of the narrow ways—all with looks intent towards\none point. Marlborough Street itself was the focus of all those human\neyes, that betrayed intensest interest of various kinds; some fierce\nwith anger, some lowering with relentless threats, some dilated with\nfear, or imploring entreaty; and, as Margaret reached the small\nside-entrance by the folding doors, in the great dead wall of\nMarlborough mill-yard and waited the porter's answer to the bell, she\nlooked round and heard the first long far-off roll of the tempest;—saw\nthe first slow-surging wave of the dark crowd come, with its threatening\ncrest, tumble over, and retreat, at the far end of the street, which a\nmoment ago, seemed so full of repressed noise, but which now was\nominously still; all these circumstances forced themselves on Margaret's\nnotice, but did not sink down into her pre-occupied heart. She did not\nknow what they meant—what was their deep significance; while she did\nknow, did feel the keen sharp pressure of the knife that was soon to\nstab her through and through by leaving her motherless. She was trying\nto realise that, in order that, when it came, she might be ready to\ncomfort her father."

Again she took her place by the farthest window. He was on\nthe steps below; she saw that by the direction of a thousand angry eyes;\nbut she could neither see nor hear anything save the savage satisfaction\nof the rolling angry murmur. She threw the window wide open. Many in the\ncrowd were mere boys; cruel and thoughtless,—cruel because they were\nthoughtless; some were men, gaunt as wolves, and mad for prey. She knew\nhow it was; they were like Boucher, with starving children at\nhome—relying on ultimate success in their efforts to get higher wages,\nand enraged beyond measure at discovering that Irishmen were to be\nbrought in to rob their little ones of bread. Margaret knew it all; she\nread it in Boucher's face, forlornly desperate and livid with rage. If\nMr. Thornton would but say something to them—let them hear his voice\nonly—it seemed as if it would be better than this wild beating and\nraging against the stony silence that vouchsafed them no word, even of\nanger or reproach. But perhaps he was speaking now; there was a\nmomentary hush of their noise, inarticulate as that of a troop of\nanimals. She tore her bonnet off; and bent forwards to hear. She could\nonly see; for if Mr. Thornton had indeed made the attempt to speak, the\nmomentary instinct to listen to him was past and gone, and the people\nwere raging worse than ever. He stood with his arms folded; still as a\nstatue; his face pale with repressed excitement. They were trying to\nintimidate him—to make him flinch; each was urging the other on to some\nimmediate act of personal violence. Margaret felt intuitively, that in\nan instant all would be uproar; the first touch would cause an\nexplosion, in which, among such hundreds of infuriated men and reckless\nboys, even Mr. Thornton's life would be unsafe,—that in another instant\nthe stormy passions would have passed their bounds, and swept away all\nbarriers of reason, or apprehension of consequence. Even while she\nlooked, she saw lads in the back-ground stooping to take off their heavy\nwooden clogs—the readiest missile they could find; she saw it was the\nspark to the gunpowder, and, with a cry, which no one heard, she rushed\nout of the room, down stairs,—she had lifted the great iron bar of the\ndoor with an imperious force—had thrown the door open wide—and was\nthere, in face of that angry sea of men, her eyes smiting them with\nflaming arrows of reproach. The clogs were arrested in the hands that\nheld them—the countenances, so fell not a moment before, now looked\nirresolute, and as if asking what this meant. For she stood between them\nand their enemy. She could not speak, but held out her arms towards them\ntill she could recover breath."

An involuntary comparison between Mr. Lennox and Mr.\nThornton arose in her mind. She had been sorry that an expression of any\nother feeling than friendship had been lured out by circumstances from\nHenry Lennox. That regret was the predominant feeling, on the first\noccasion of her receiving a proposal. She had not felt so stunned—so\nimpressed as she did now, when echoes of Mr. Thornton's voice yet\nlingered about the room. In Lennox's case, he seemed for a moment to\nhave slid over the boundary between friendship and love; and the instant\nafterwards, to regret it nearly as much as she did, although for\ndifferent reasons. In Mr. Thornton's case, as far as Margaret knew,\nthere was no intervening stage of friendship. Their intercourse had been\none continued series of opposition. Their opinions clashed; and indeed,\nshe had never perceived that he had cared for her opinions, as belonging\nto her, the individual. As far as they defied his rock-like power of\ncharacter, his passion-strength, he seemed to throw them off from him\nwith contempt, until she felt the weariness of the exertion of making\nuseless protests; and now, he had come, in this strange wild passionate\nway, to make known his love. For, although at first it had struck her,\nthat his offer was forced and goaded out of him by sharp compassion for\nthe exposure she had made of herself,—which he, like others, might\nmisunderstand—yet, even before he left the room,—and certainly, not\nfive minutes after, the clear conviction dawned upon her, shined bright\nupon her, that he did love her; that he had loved her; that he would\nlove her. And she shrank and shuddered as under the fascination of some\ngreat power, repugnant to her whole previous life. She crept away, and\nhid from his idea. But it was of no use.

He called himself a fool for\nsuffering so; and yet he could not, at the moment, recollect the cause\nof his suffering, and whether it was adequate to the consequences it had\nproduced. It would have been a relief to him, if he could have sat down\nand cried on a door-step by a little child, who was raging and storming,\nthrough his passionate tears, at some injury he had received. He said to\nhimself, that he hated Margaret, but a wild, sharp sensation of love\ncleft his dull, thunderous feeling like lightning, even as he shaped the\nwords expressive of hatred. His greatest comfort was in hugging his\ntorment; and in feeling, as he had indeed said to her, that though she\nmight despise him, contemn him, treat him with her proud sovereign\nindifference, he did not change one whit.

Then everybody got down; and so did\nMr. Thornton, and because they walked away he did so too. He went into\nthe fields, walking briskly, because the sharp motion relieved his mind.\nHe could remember all about it now; the pitiful figure he must have cut;\nthe absurd way in which he had gone and done the very thing he had so\noften agreed with himself in thinking would be the most foolish thing in\nthe world; and had met with exactly the consequences which, in these\nwise moods, he had always fore-told were certain to follow, if he ever\ndid make such a fool of himself. Was he bewitched by those beautiful\neyes, that soft, half-open, sighing mouth which lay so close upon his\nshoulder only yesterday? He could not even shake off the recollection\nthat she had been there; that her arms had been round him, once—if\nnever again. He only caught glimpses of her; he did not understand her\naltogether. At one time she was so brave, and at another so timid; now\nso tender, and then so haughty and regal-proud. And then he thought over\nevery time he had ever seen her once again, by way of finally forgetting\nher. He saw her in every dress, in every mood, and did not know which\nbecame her best.

She had braced herself up\nmany and many a time, at some sudden noise in the house; had caught up\nthe half-dropped work, and begun to ply her needle diligently, though\nthrough dimmed spectacles, and with an unsteady hand! and many times had\nthe door opened, and some indifferent person entered on some\ninsignificant errand. Then her rigid face unstiffened from its gray\nfrost-bound expression, and the features dropped into the relaxed look\nof despondency, so unusual to their sternness. She wrenched herself away\nfrom the contemplation of all the dreary changes that would be brought\nabout to herself by her son's marriage; she forced her thoughts into the\naccustomed household grooves. The newly-married couple-to-be would need\nfresh household stocks of linen; and Mrs. Thornton had clothes-basket\nupon clothes-basket, full of table-cloths and napkins, brought in, and\nbegan to reckon up the store. There was some confusion between what was\nhers, and consequently marked G. H. T. (for George and Hannah Thornton),\nand what was her son's—bought with his money, marked with his initials.\nSome of those marked G. H. T. were Dutch damask of the old kind,\nexquisitely fine; none were like them now. Mrs. Thornton stood looking\nat them long,—they had been her pride when she was first married. Then\nshe knit her brows, and pinched and compressed her lips tight, and\ncarefully unpicked the G. H. She went so far as to search for the\nTurkey-red marking-thread to put in the new initials; but it was all\nused,—and she had no heart to send for any more just yet. So she looked\nfixedly at vacancy; a series of visions passing before her, in all of\nwhich her son was the principal, the sole object,—her son, her pride,\nher property. Still he did not come. Doubtless he was with Miss Hale.\nThe new love was displacing her already from her place as first in his\nheart. A terrible pain—a pang of vain jealousy—shot through her: she\nhardly knew whether it was more physical or mental; but it forced her to\nsit down. In a moment, she was up again as straight as ever,—a grim\nsmile upon her face for the first time that day, ready for the door\nopening, and the rejoicing triumphant one, who should never know the\nsore regret his mother felt at his marriage. In all this, there was\nlittle thought enough of the future daughter-in-law as an individual.\nShe was to be John's wife. To take Mrs. Thornton's place as mistress of\nthe house, was only one of the rich consequences which decked out the\nsupreme glory; all household plenty and comfort, all purple and fine\nlinen, honour, love, obedience, troops of friends, would all come as\nnaturally as jewels on a king's robe, and be as little thought of for\ntheir separate value. To be chosen by John, would separate a\nkitchen-wench from the rest of the world. And Miss Hale was not so bad.\nIf she had been a Milton lass, Mrs. Thornton would have positively liked\nher. She was pungent, and had taste, and spirit, and flavour in her.\nTrue, she was sadly prejudiced, and very ignorant; but that was to be\nexpected from her southern breeding. A strange sort of mortified\ncomparison of Fanny with her, went on in Mrs. Thornton's mind; and for\nonce she spoke harshly to her daughter; abused her roundly; and then, as\nif by way of penance, she took up Henry's Commentaries, and tried to fix\nher attention on it, instead of pursuing the employment she took pride\nand pleasure in, and continuing her inspection of the table-linen."

I'm sure it would be the very best thing for Aunt Hale's\nhealth; everybody here is young and well, and our skies are always blue,\nand our sun always shines, and the band plays deliciously from morning\ntill night; and, to come back to the burden of my ditty, my baby always\nsmiles. I am constantly wanting you to draw him for me, Margaret. It\ndoes not signify what he is doing; that very thing is prettiest,\ngracefulest, best. I think I love him a great deal better than my\nhusband, who is getting stout, and grumpy,—what he calls \"busy.\" No! he\nis not. He has just come in with news of such a charming pic-nic, given\nby the officers of the Hazard, at anchor in the bay below. Because he\nhas brought in such a pleasant piece of news, I retract all I said just\nnow. Did not somebody burn his hand for having said or done something he\nwas sorry for? Well, I can't burn mine, because it would hurt me, and\nthe scar would be ugly; but I'll retract all I said as fast as I can.\nCosmo is quite as great a darling as baby, and not a bit stout, and as\nun-grumpy as ever husband was; only, sometimes he is very, very busy. I\nmay say that without love—wifely duty—where was I?—I had something\nvery particular to say, I know, once. Oh, it is this—Dearest\nMargaret!—you must come and see me; it would do Aunt Hale good, as I\nsaid before. Get the doctor to order it for her. Tell him that it's the\nsmoke of Milton that does her harm. I have no doubt it is that, really.\nThree months (you must not come for less) of this delicious climate—all\nsunshine, and grapes as common as blackberries, would quite cure her. I\ndon't ask my uncle'—(Here the letter became more constrained, and\nbetter written; Mr. Hale was in the corner, like a naughty child, for\nhaving given up his living.)—'because, I dare say, he disapproves of\nwar, and soldiers, and bands of music; at least, I know that many\nDissenters are members of the Peace Society, and I am afraid he would\nnot like to come; but, if he would, dear, pray say that Cosmo and I will\ndo our best to make him happy; and I'll hide up Cosmo's red coat and\nsword, and make the band play all sorts of grave, solemn things; or, if\nthey do play pomps and vanities, it shall be in double slow time. Dear\nMargaret, if he would like to accompany you and Aunt Hale, we will try\nand make it pleasant, though I'm rather afraid of any one who has done\nsomething for conscience sake. You never did, I hope. Tell Aunt Hale not\nto bring many warm clothes, though I'm afraid it will be late in the\nyear before you can come. But you have no idea of the heat here! I tried\nto wear my great beauty Indian shawl at a pic-nic. I kept myself up with\nproverbs as long as I could; \"Pride must abide,\"—and such wholesome\npieces of pith; but it was of no use. I was like mamma's little dog Tiny\nwith an elephant's trappings on; smothered, hidden, killed with my\nfinery; so I made it into a capital carpet for us all to sit down upon.\nHere's this boy of mine, Margaret,—if you don't pack up your things as\nsoon as you get this letter, a come straight off to see him, I shall\nthink you're descended from King Herod!'"

Not her father's desponding attitude had power to damp her now.\nHe lay across the table, helpless as ever; but she had the spell by\nwhich to rouse him.

Each glimpse into the room where he sate by his\nfather, conversing with him, about, she knew not what, nor cared to\nknow,—was increase of strength to her. Her own time for talking and\nhearing would come at last, and she was too certain of this to feel in a\nhurry to grasp it now. She took in his appearance and liked it. He had\ndelicate features, redeemed from effeminacy by the swarthiness of his\ncomplexion, and his quick intensity of expression. His eyes were\ngenerally merry-looking, but at times they and his mouth so suddenly\nchanged, and gave her such an idea of latent passion, that it almost\nmade her afraid. But this look was only for an instant; and had in it no\ndoggedness, no vindictiveness; it was rather the instantaneous ferocity\nof expression that comes over the countenances of all natives of wild or\nsouthern countries—a ferocity which enhances the charm of the childlike\nsoftness into which such a look may melt away. Margaret might fear the\nviolence of the impulsive nature thus occasionally betrayed, but there\nwas nothing in it to make her distrust, or recoil in the least, from the\nnew-found brother. On the contrary, all their intercourse was peculiarly\ncharming to her from the very first. She knew then how much\nresponsibility she had had to bear, from the exquisite sensation of\nrelief which she felt in Frederick's presence. He understood his father\nand mother—their characters and their weaknesses, and went along with a\ncareless freedom, which was yet most delicately careful not to hurt or\nwound any of their feelings. He seemed to know instinctively when a\nlittle of the natural brilliancy of his manner and conversation would\nnot jar on the deep depression of his father, or might relieve his\nmother's pain. Whenever it would have been out of tune, and out of time,\nhis patient devotion and watchfulness came into play, and made him an\nadmirable nurse. Then Margaret was almost touched into tears by the\nallusions which he often made to their childish days in the New Forest;\nhe had never forgotten her—or Helstone either—all the time he had been\nroaming among distant countries and foreign people. She might talk to\nhim of the old spot, and never fear tiring him. She had been afraid of\nhim before he came, even while she had longed for his coming; seven or\neight years had, she felt, produced such great changes in herself that,\nforgetting how much of the original Margaret was left, she had reasoned\nthat if her tastes and feelings had so materially altered, even in her\nstay-at-home life, his wild career, with which she was but imperfectly\nacquainted, must have almost substituted another Frederick for the tall\nstripling in his middy's uniform, whom she remembered looking up to with\nsuch admiring awe. But in their absence they had grown nearer to each\nother in age, as well as in many other things. And so it was that the\nweight, this sorrowful time, was lightened to Margaret. Other light than\nthat of Frederick's presence she had none. For a few hours, the mother\nrallied on seeing her son. She sate with his hand in hers; she would not\npart with it even while she slept; and Margaret had to feed him like a\nbaby, rather than that he should disturb her mother by removing a\nfinger. Mrs. Hale wakened while they were thus engaged; she slowly moved\nher head round on the pillow, and smiled at her children, as she\nunderstood what they were doing, and why it was done."

Consequently,\nafter some consideration, Frederick had determined upon remaining in\nLondon a day or two longer.

Margaret might be assured he would take every precaution against\nbeing tracked by Leonards. Margaret was thankful that she received this\nletter while her father was absent in her mother's room. If he had been\npresent, he would have expected her to read it aloud to him, and it\nwould have raised in him a state of nervous alarm which she would have\nfound it impossible to soothe away.

Margaret summoned up all her forces to her\naid. Her father seemed to have forgotten that they had any reason to\nexpect a letter from Frederick that morning. He was absorbed in one\nidea—that the last visible token of the presence of his wife was to be\ncarried away from him, and hidden from his sight.

Mr. Thornton said\nvery little; but every sentence he uttered added to Mr. Hale's reliance\nand regard for him. Was it that he paused in the expression of some\nremembered agony, Mr. Thornton's two or three words would complete the\nsentence, and show how deeply its meaning was entered into. Was it a\ndoubt—a fear—a wandering uncertainty seeking rest, but finding\nnone—so tear-blinded were its eyes—Mr. Thornton, instead of being\nshocked, seemed to have passed through that very stage of thought\nhimself, and could suggest where the exact ray of light was to be found,\nwhich should make the dark places plain. Man of action as he was, busy\nin the world's great battle, there was a deeper religion binding him to\nGod in his heart, in spite of his strong wilfulness, through all his\nmistakes, than Mr. Hale had ever dreamed. They never spoke of such\nthings again, as it happened; but this one conversation made them\npeculiar people to each other; knit them together, in a way which no\nloose indiscriminate talking about sacred things can ever accomplish.\nWhen all are admitted, how can there be a Holy of Holies?"

If he had but known how\nMargaret would have become involved in the affair—if he had but\nforeseen that she would have stained her whiteness by a falsehood, he\ncould have saved her by a word; for the question, of inquest or no\ninquest, had hung trembling in the balance only the night before.

It seemed to\nher so sacrilegious to be peering into that poor distorted, agonised\nface, that, by a flash of instinct, she went forwards and softly covered\nthe dead man's countenance with her handkerchief. The eyes that saw her\ndo this followed her, as she turned away from her pious office, and were\nthus led to the place where Nicholas Higgins stood, like one rooted to\nthe spot. The men spoke together, and then one of them came up to\nHiggins, who would have fain shrunk back into his house."

But her father set too high a\nstandard, and too abstract a view, before the indolent invalid. She\ncould not rouse her torpid mind into any vivid imagination of what her\nhusband's misery might have been before he had resorted to the last\nterrible step; she could only look upon it as it affected herself; she\ncould not enter into the enduring mercy of the God who had not specially\ninterposed to prevent the water from drowning her prostrate husband; and\nalthough she was secretly blaming her husband for having fallen into\nsuch drear despair, and denying that he had any excuse for his last rash\nact, she was inveterate in her abuse of all who could by any possibility\nbe supposed to have driven him to such desperation.

Her cheeks burnt as she recollected how proudly\nshe had implied an objection to trade (in the early days of their\nacquaintance), because it too often led to the deceit of passing off\ninferior for superior goods, in the one branch; of assuming credit for\nwealth and resources not possessed, in the other. She remembered Mr.\nThornton's look of calm disdain, as in few words he gave her to\nunderstand that, in the great scheme of commerce, all dishonourable ways\nof acting were sure to prove injurious in the long run, and that,\ntesting such actions simply according to the poor standard of success,\nthere was folly and not wisdom in all such, and every kind of deceit in\ntrade, as well as in other things. She remembered—she, then strong in\nher own untempted truth—asking him, if he did not think that buying in\nthe cheapest and selling in the dearest market proved some want of the\ntransparent justice which is so intimately connected with the idea of\ntruth: and she had used the word chivalric—and her father had corrected\nher with the higher word, Christian; and so drawn the argument upon\nhimself, while she sate silent by with a slight feeling of contempt."

The truth was, that there were points in their\nconversation the other night on which they had no time then to enlarge;\nbut it had been understood that if possible on the succeeding\nevening—if not then, at least the very first evening that Mr. Thornton\ncould command,—they should meet for further discussion. Mr. Hale had\nlooked forward to this meeting ever since they had parted. He had not\nyet resumed the instruction to his pupils, which he had relinquished at\nthe commencement of his wife's more serious illness, so he had fewer\noccupations than usual; and the great interest of the last day or so\n(Boucher's suicide) had driven him back with more eagerness than ever\nupon his speculations.

The\nthought of this perpetually stung him; it was a picture before his eyes,\nwherever he went and whatever he was doing. In addition to this (and he\nground his teeth as he remembered it), was the hour, dusky twilight; the\nplace, so far away from home, and comparatively unfrequented. His nobler\nself had said at first, that all this last might be accidental,\ninnocent, justifiable; but once allow her right to love and be beloved\n(and had he any reason to deny her right?—had not her words been\nseverely explicit when she cast his love away from her?), she might\neasily have been beguiled into a longer walk, on to a later hour than\nshe had anticipated. But that falsehood! which showed a fatal\nconsciousness of something wrong, and to be concealed, which was unlike\nher. He did her that justice, though all the time it would have been a\nrelief to believe her utterly unworthy of his esteem. It was this that\nmade the misery—that he passionately loved her, and thought her, even\nwith all her faults, more lovely and more excellent than any other\nwoman; yet he deemed her so attached to some other man, so led away by\nher affection for him as to violate her truthful nature. The very\nfalsehood that stained her, was a proof how blindly she loved\nanother—this dark, slight, elegant, handsome man—while he himself was\nrough, and stern, and strongly made. He lashed himself into an agony of\nfierce jealousy. He thought of that look, that attitude!—how he would\nhave laid his life at her feet for such tender glances, such fond\ndetention! He mocked at himself, for having valued the mechanical way in\nwhich she had protected him from the fury of the mob; now he had seen\nhow soft and bewitching she looked when with a man she really loved. He\nremembered, point by point, the sharpness of her words—'There was not a\nman in all that crowd for whom she would not have done as much, far more\nreadily than for him.' He shared with the mob, in her desire of averting\nbloodshed from them; but this man, this hidden lover, shared with\nnobody; he had looks, words, hand-cleavings, lies, concealment, all to\nhimself."

He bent equally\nlow in return, and then closed the door after her. As she hurried to\nMrs. Boucher's, she heard the clang, and it seemed to fill up the\nmeasure of her mortification. He too was annoyed to find her there. He\nhad tenderness in his heart—'a soft place,' as Nicholas Higgins called\nit; but he had some pride in concealing it; he kept it very sacred and\nsafe, and was jealous of every circumstance that tried to gain\nadmission. But if he dreaded exposure of his tenderness, he was equally\ndesirous that all men should recognise his justice; and he felt that he\nhad been unjust, in giving so scornful a hearing to any one who had\nwaited, with humble patience, for five hours, to speak to him. That the\nman had spoken saucily to him when he had the opportunity, was nothing\nto Mr. Thornton. He rather liked him for it; and he was conscious of his\nown irritability of temper at the time, which probably made them both\nquits. It was the five hours of waiting that struck Mr. Thornton. He had\nnot five hours to spare himself; but one hour—two hours, of his hard\npenetrating intellectual, as well as bodily labour, did he give up to\ngoing about collecting evidence as to the truth of Higgins's story, the\nnature of his character, the tenor of his life. He tried not to be, but\nwas convinced that all that Higgins had said was true. And then the\nconviction went in, as if by some spell, and touched the latent\ntenderness of his heart; the patience of the man, the simple generosity\nof the motive (for he had learnt about the quarrel between Boucher and\nHiggins), made him forget entirely the mere reasonings of justice, and\noverleap them by a diviner instinct. He came to tell Higgins he would\ngive him work; and he was more annoyed to find Margaret there than by\nhearing her last words, for then he understood that she was the woman\nwho had urged Higgins to come to him; and he dreaded the admission of\nany thought of her, as a motive to what he was doing solely because it\nwas right."

In the middle of\nthe evening, she was called down to speak to Mary Higgins; and when she\ncame back, Mr. Hale imagined that he saw traces of tears on her cheeks.\nBut that could not be, for she brought good news—that Higgins had got\nwork at Mr. Thornton's mill. Her spirits were damped, at any rate, and\nshe found it very difficult to go on talking at all, much more in the\nwild way that she had done. For some days her spirits varied strangely;\nand her father was beginning to be anxious about her, when news arrived\nfrom one or two quarters that promised some change and variety for her.\nMr. Hale received a letter from Mr. Bell, in which that gentleman\nvolunteered a visit to them; and Mr. Hale imagined that the promised\nsociety of his old Oxford friend would give as agreeable a turn to\nMargaret's ideas as it did to his own. Margaret tried to take an\ninterest in what pleased her father; but she was too languid to care\nabout any Mr. Bell, even though he were twenty times her godfather. She\nwas more roused by a letter from Edith, full of sympathy about her\naunt's death; full of details about herself, her husband, and child; and\nat the end saying, that as the climate did not suit the baby, and as\nMrs. Shaw was talking of returning to England, she thought it probable\nthat Captain Lennox might sell out, and that they might all go and live\nagain in the old Harley Street house; which, however, would seem very\nincomplete with-out Margaret. Margaret yearned after that old house, and\nthe placid tranquillity of that old well-ordered, monotonous life. She\nhad found it occasionally tiresome while it lasted; but since then she\nhad been buffeted about, and felt so exhausted by this recent struggle\nwith herself, that she thought that even stagnation would be a rest and\na refreshment. So she began to look towards a long visit to the\nLennoxes, on their return to England, as to a point—no, not of\nhope—but of leisure, in which she could regain her power and command\nover herself. At present it seemed to her as if all subjects tended\ntowards Mr. Thornton; as if she could not forget him with all her\nendeavours. If she went to see the Higginses, she heard of him there;\nher father had resumed their readings together, and quoted his opinions\nperpetually; even Mr. Bell's visit brought his tenant's name upon the\ntapis; for he wrote word that he believed he must be occupied some great\npart of his time with Mr. Thornton, as a new lease was in preparation,\nand the terms of it must be agreed upon."

And\nthen to speak to Margaret as he had done! She did not get up and leave\nthe room, as she had done in former days, when his abruptness or his\ntemper had annoyed her. She sat quite still, after the first momentary\nglance of grieved surprise, that made her eyes look like some child's\nwho has met with an unexpected rebuff; they slowly dilated into\nmournful, reproachful sadness; and then they fell, and she bent over her\nwork, and did not speak again. But he could not help looking at her, and\nhe saw a sigh tremble over her body, as if she quivered in some unwonted\nchill. He felt as the mother would have done, in the midst of 'her\nrocking it, and rating it,' had she been called away before her slow\nconfiding smile, implying perfect trust in mother's love, had proved the\nrenewing of its love. He gave short sharp answers; he was uneasy and\ncross, unable to discern between jest and earnest; anxious only for a\nlook, a word of hers, before which to prostrate himself in penitent\nhumility. But she neither looked nor spoke. Her round taper fingers flew\nin and out of her sewing, as steadily and swiftly as if that were the\nbusiness of her life. She could not care for him, he thought, or else\nthe passionate fervour of his wish would have forced her to raise those\neyes, if but for an instant, to read the late repentance in his. He\ncould have struck her before he left, in order that by some strange\novert act of rudeness, he might earn the privilege of telling her the\nremorse that gnawed at his heart. It was well that the long walk in the\nopen air wound up this evening for him. It sobered him back into grave\nresolution, that henceforth he would see as little of her as\npossible,—since the very sight of that face and form, the very sounds\nof that voice (like the soft winds of pure melody) had such power to\nmove him from his balance. Well! He had known what love was—a sharp\npang, a fierce experience, in the midst of whose flames he was\nstruggling! but, through that furnace he would fight his way out into\nthe serenity of middle age,—all the richer and more human for having\nknown this great passion."

Mrs. Thornton had of course\nentirely ceased to come to the house. Mr. Thornton came occasionally,\nbut his visits were addressed to her father, and were confined to the\nstudy. Mr. Hale spoke of him as always the same; indeed, the very rarity\nof their intercourse seemed to make Mr. Hale set only the higher value\non it. And from what Margaret could gather of what Mr. Thornton had\nsaid, there was nothing in the cessation of his visits which could arise\nfrom any umbrage or vexation. His business affairs had become\ncomplicated during the strike, and required closer attention than he had\ngiven to them last winter. Nay, Margaret could even discover that he\nspoke from time to time of her, and always, as far as she could learn,\nin the same calm friendly way, never avoiding and never seeking any\nmention of her name."

The dreary\npeacefulness of the present time had been preceded by so long a period\nof anxiety and care—even intermixed with storms—that her mind had lost\nits elasticity.

Not a mood of his but\nwhat found a ready sympathiser in Margaret; not a wish of his that she\ndid not strive to forecast, and to fulfil. They were quiet wishes to be\nsure, and hardly named without hesitation and apology. All the more\ncomplete and beautiful was her meek spirit of obedience. March brought\nthe news of Frederick's marriage. He and Dolores wrote; she in\nSpanish-English, as was but natural, and he with little turns and\ninversions of words which proved how far the idioms of his bride's\ncountry were infecting him."

All of which made Margaret cry sorely, so\nunnatural did it seem to her at the first opening; but on consideration,\nshe saw rather in such expression the poignancy of the disappointment\nwhich had thus crushed his hopes; and she felt that there was nothing\nfor it but patience. In the next letter, Frederick spoke so joyfully of\nthe future that he had no thought for the past; and Margaret found a use\nin herself for the patience she had been craving for him. She would have\nto be patient. But the pretty, timid, girlish letters of Dolores were\nbeginning to have a charm for both Margaret and her father. The young\nSpaniard was so evidently anxious to make a favourable impression upon\nher lover's English relations, that her feminine care peeped out at\nevery erasure; and the letters announcing the marriage, were accompanied\nby a splendid black lace mantilla, chosen by Dolores herself for her\nunseen sister-in-law, whom Frederick had represented as a paragon of\nbeauty, wisdom and virtue. Frederick's worldly position was raised by\nthis marriage on to as high a level as they could desire. Barbour and\nCo. was one of the most extensive Spanish houses, and into it he was\nreceived as a junior partner. Margaret smiled a little, and then sighed\nas she remembered afresh her old tirades against trade. Here was her\npreux chevalier of a brother turned merchant, trader! But then she\nrebelled against herself, and protested silently against the confusion\nimplied between a Spanish merchant and a Milton mill-owner. Well! trade\nor no trade, Frederick was very, very happy. Dolores must be charming,\nand the mantilla was exquisite! And then she returned to the present\nlife."

Captain Lennox and Mr. Thornton are\nhere. The former seems a smart, well-meaning man; and has proposed to go\nover to Milton, and assist you in any search for the will; of course\nthere is none, or you would have found it by this time, if you followed\nmy directions. Then the Captain declares he must take you and his\nmother-in-law home; and, in his wife's present state, I don't see how\nyou can expect him to remain away longer than Friday. However, that\nDixon of yours is trusty; and can hold her, or your own, till I come. I\nwill put matters into the hands of my Milton attorney if there is no\nwill; for I doubt this smart captain is no great man of business.\nNevertheless, his moustachios are splendid. There will have to be a\nsale, so select what things you wish reserved. Or you can send a list\nafterwards. Now two things more, and I have done. You know, or if you\ndon't, your poor father did, that you are to have my money and goods\nwhen I die. Not that I mean to die yet; but I name this just to explain\nwhat is coming. These Lennoxes seem very fond of you now; and perhaps\nmay continue to be; perhaps not. So it is best to start with a formal\nagreement; namely, that you are to pay them two hundred and fifty pounds\na year, as long as you and they find it pleasant to live together.\n(This, of course, includes Dixon; mind you don't be cajoled into paying\nany more for her.) Then you won't be thrown adrift, if some day the\ncaptain wishes to have his house to himself, but you can carry yourself\nand your two hundred and fifty pounds off somewhere else; if, indeed, I\nhave not claimed you to come and keep house for me first. Then as to\ndress, and Dixon, and personal expenses, and confectionery (all young\nladies eat confectionery till wisdom comes by age), I shall consult some\nlady of my acquaintance, and see how much you will have from your father\nbefore fixing this. Now, Margaret, have you flown out before you have\nread this far, and wondered what right the old man has to settle your\naffairs for you so cavalierly? I make no doubt you have. Yet the old man\nhas a right. He has loved your father for five and thirty years; he\nstood beside him on his wedding-day; he closed his eyes in death.\nMoreover, he is your godfather; and as he cannot do you much good\nspiritually, having a hidden consciousness of your superiority in such\nthings, he would fain do you the poor good of endowing you materially.\nAnd the old man has not a known relation on earth; \"who is there to\nmourn for Adam Bell?\" and his whole heart is set and bent upon this one\nthing, and Margaret Hale is not the girl to say him nay. Write by\nreturn, if only two lines, to tell me your answer. But <em>no thanks</em>.'"

It gave her time to comprehend the sudden\nchange which had taken place in her circumstances within the last two\nmonths. She found herself at once an inmate of a luxurious house, where\nthe bare knowledge of the existence of every trouble or care seemed\nscarcely to have penetrated. The wheels of the machinery of daily life\nwere well oiled, and went along with delicious smoothness. Mrs. Shaw and\nEdith could hardly make enough of Margaret, on her return to what they\npersisted in calling her home. And she felt that it was almost\nungrateful in her to have a secret feeling that the Helstone\nvicarage—nay, even the poor little house at Milton, with her anxious\nfather and her invalid mother, and all the small household cares of\ncomparative poverty, composed her idea of home. Edith was impatient to\nget well, in order to fill Margaret's bed-room with all the soft\ncomforts, and pretty nick-knacks, with which her own abounded. Mrs. Shaw\nand her maid found plenty of occupation in restoring Margaret's wardrobe\nto a state of elegant variety. Captain Lennox was easy, kind, and\ngentlemanly; sate with his wife in her dressing-room an hour or two\nevery day; played with his little boy for another hour, and lounged away\nthe rest of his time at his club, when he was not engaged out to dinner.\nJust before Margaret had recovered from her necessity for quiet and\nrepose—before she had begun to feel her life wanting and dull—Edith\ncame down-stairs and resumed her usual part in the household; and\nMargaret fell into the old habit of watching, and admiring, and\nministering to her cousin. She gladly took all charge of the semblances\nof duties off Edith's hands; answered notes, reminded her of\nengagements, tended her when no gaiety was in prospect, and she was\nconsequently rather inclined to fancy herself ill. But all the rest of\nthe family were in the full business of the London season, and Margaret\nwas often left alone. Then her thoughts went back to Milton, with a\nstrange sense of the contrast between the life there, and here. She was\ngetting surfeited of the eventless ease in which no struggle or\nendeavour was required. She was afraid lest she should even become\nsleepily deadened into forgetfulness of anything beyond the life which\nwas lapping her round with luxury. There might be toilers and moilers\nthere in London, but she never saw them; the very servants lived in an\nunderground world of their own, of which she knew neither the hopes nor\nthe fears; they only seemed to start into existence when some want or\nwhim of their master and mistress needed them. There was a strange\nunsatisfied vacuum in Margaret's heart and mode of life; and, once when\nshe had dimly hinted this to Edith, the latter, wearied with dancing the\nnight before, languidly stroked Margaret's cheek as she sat by her in\nthe old attitude,—she on a footstool by the sofa where Edith lay."

Captain Lennox was always\nextremely kind and brotherly to Margaret. She was really very fond of\nhim, excepting when he was anxiously attentive to Edith's dress and\nappearance, with a view to her beauty making a sufficient impression on\nthe world.

Where were those who spoke to him, moved around him, touched him,\nnot an instant ago? Dead! buried! lost for evermore, as far as earth's\nfor evermore would extend. He was an old man, so lately exultant in the\nfull strength of manhood. The utter loneliness of his life was\ninsupportable to think about. He got up hastily, and tried to forget\nwhat never more might be, in a hurried dressing for the breakfast in\nHarley Street."

Her last alarm was lest they should be too\nlate and miss the train; but no! they were all in time; and she breathed\nfreely and happily at length, seated in the carriage opposite to Mr.\nBell, and whirling away past the well-known stations; seeing the old\nsouth country-towns and hamlets sleeping in the warm light of the pure\nsun, which gave a yet ruddier colour to their tiled roofs, so different\nto the cold slates of the north. Broods of pigeons hovered around these\npeaked quaint gables, slowly settling here and there, and ruffling their\nsoft, shiny feathers, as if exposing every fibre to the delicious\nwarmth. There were few people about at the stations, it almost seemed as\nif they were too lazily content to wish to travel; none of the bustle\nand stir that Margaret had noticed in her two journeys on the London and\nNorth-Western line. Later on in the year, this line of railway should be\nstirring and alive with rich pleasure-seekers; but as to the constant\ngoing to and fro of busy trades-people it would always be widely\ndifferent from the northern lines. Here a spectator or two stood\nlounging at nearly every station, with his hands in his pockets, so\nabsorbed in the simple act of watching, that it made the travellers\nwonder what he could find to do when the train whirled away, and only\nthe blank of a railway, some sheds, and a distant field or two were left\nfor him to gaze upon. The hot air danced over the golden stillness of\nthe land, farm after farm was left behind, each reminding Margaret of\nGerman Idyls—of Herman and Dorothea—of Evangeline. From this waking\ndream she was roused. It was the place to leave the train and take the\nfly to Helstone. And now sharper feelings came shooting through her\nheart, whether pain or pleasure she could hardly tell. Every mile was\nredolent of associations, which she would not have missed for the world,\nbut each of which made her cry upon 'the days that are no more,' with\nineffable longing. The last time she had passed along this road was when\nshe had left it with her father and mother—the day, the season, had\nbeen gloomy, and she herself hopeless, but they were there with her. Now\nshe was alone, an orphan, and they, strangely, had gone away from her,\nand vanished from the face of the earth. It hurt her to see the Helstone\nroad so flooded in the sun-light, and every turn and every familiar tree\nso precisely the same in its summer glory as it had been in former\nyears. Nature felt no change, and was ever young."

The new window gave a view of the road, and had many advantages,\nas Mrs. Hepworth pointed out. From it the wandering sheep of her\nhusband's flock might be seen, who straggled to the tempting beer-house,\nunobserved as they might hope, but not unobserved in reality; for the\nactive Vicar kept his eye on the road, even during the composition of\nhis most orthodox sermons, and had a hat and stick hanging ready at hand\nto seize, before sallying out after his parishioners, who had need of\nquick legs if they could take refuge in the 'Jolly Forester' before the\nteetotal Vicar had arrested them.

She brought endless pieces of Milton gossip: How Martha\nhad gone to live with Miss Thornton, on the latter's marriage; with an\naccount of the bridesmaids, dresses and breakfasts, at that interesting\nceremony; how people thought that Mr. Thornton had made too grand a\nwedding of it, considering he had lost a deal by the strike, and had had\nto pay so much for the failure of his contracts; how little money\narticles of furniture—long cherished by Dixon—had fetched at the sale,\nwhich was a shame considering how rich folks were at Milton; how Mrs.\nThornton had come one day and got two or three good bargains, and Mr.\nThornton had come the next, and in his desire to obtain one or two\nthings, had bid against himself, much to the enjoyment of the\nbystanders, so as Dixon observed, that made things even; if Mrs.\nThornton paid too little, Mr. Thornton paid too much. Mr. Bell had sent\nall sorts of orders about the books; there was no understanding him, he\nwas so particular; if he had come himself it would have been all right,\nbut letters always were and always will be more puzzling than they are\nworth. Dixon had not much to tell about the Higginses. Her memory had an\naristocratic bias, and was very treacherous whenever she tried to recall\nany circumstance connected with those below her in life. Nicholas was\nvery well she believed. He had been several times at the house asking\nfor news of Miss Margaret—the only person who ever did ask, except once\nMr. Thornton. And Mary? oh! of course she was very well, a great, stout,\nslatternly thing! She did hear, or perhaps it was only a dream of hers,\nthough it would be strange if she had dreamt of such people as the\nHigginses, that Mary had gone to work at Mr. Thornton's mill, because\nher father wished her to know how to cook; but what nonsense that could\nmean she didn't know. Margaret rather agreed with her that the story was\nincoherent enough to be like a dream. Still it was pleasant to have some\none now with whom she could talk of Milton, and Milton people. Dixon was\nnot over-fond of the subject, rather wishing to leave that part of her\nlife in shadow. She liked much more to dwell upon speeches of Mr.\nBell's, which had suggested an idea to her of what was really his\nintention—making Margaret his heiress. But her young lady gave her no\nencouragement, nor in any way gratified her insinuating enquiries,\nhowever disguised in the form of suspicions or assertions."

Mr. Bell was no great correspondent, but he\nwrote from time to time long or short letters, as the humour took him,\nand although Margaret was not conscious of any definite hope, on\nreceiving them, yet she always put away his notes with a little feeling\nof disappointment. He was not going to Milton; he said nothing about it\nat any rate. Well! she must be patient. Sooner or later the mists would\nbe cleared away. Mr. Bell's letters were hardly like his usual self;\nthey were short, and complaining, with every now and then a little touch\nof bitterness that was unusual. He did not look forward to the future;\nhe rather seemed to regret the past, and be weary of the present.\nMargaret fancied that he could not be well; but in answer to some\nenquiry of hers as to his health, he sent her a short note, saying there\nwas an old-fashioned complaint called the spleen; that he was suffering\nfrom that, and it was for her to decide if it was more mental or\nphysical; but that he should like to indulge himself in grumbling,\nwithout being obliged to send a bulletin every time."

She questioned and cross-questioned Edith, till the latter was\nweary, and declared that there was nothing more to remember; all he had\nsaid was that he half-thought he should go, and hear for himself what\nFrederick had to say about the mutiny; and that it would be a good\nopportunity for Margaret to become acquainted with her new\nsister-in-law; that he always went somewhere during the long vacation,\nand did not see why he should not go to Spain as well as anywhere else.\nThat was all. Edith hoped Margaret did not want to leave them, that she\nwas so anxious about all this. And then, having nothing else particular\nto do, she cried, and said that she knew she cared much more for\nMargaret than Margaret did for her. Margaret comforted her as well as\nshe could, but she could hardly explain to her how this idea of Spain,\nmere chateau en Espagne as it might be, charmed and delighted her. Edith\nwas in the mood to think that any pleasure enjoyed away from her was a\ntacit affront, or at best a proof of indifference. So Margaret had to\nkeep her pleasure to herself, and could only let it escape by the\nsafety-valve of asking Dixon, when she dressed for dinner, if she would\nnot like to see Master Frederick and his new wife very much indeed?"

Mrs.\nShaw was as good-tempered as could be; and Edith had inherited this\ncharming domestic quality; Margaret herself had probably the worst\ntemper of the three, for her quick perceptions, and over-lively\nimagination made her hasty, and her early isolation from sympathy had\nmade her proud; but she had an indescribable childlike sweetness of\nheart, which made her manners, even in her rarely wilful moods,\nirresistible of old; and now, chastened even by what the world called\nher good fortune, she charmed her reluctant aunt into acquiescence with\nher will.

In the streets\nthere were few loiterers,—none walking for mere pleasure; every man's\nface was set in lines of eagerness or anxiety; news was sought for with\nfierce avidity; and men jostled each other aside in the Mart and in the\nExchange, as they did in life, in the deep selfishness of competition.\nThere was gloom over the town. Few came to buy, and those who did were\nlooked at suspiciously by the sellers; for credit was insecure, and the\nmost stable might have their fortunes affected by the sweep in the great\nneighbouring port among the shipping houses. Hitherto there had been no\nfailures in Milton; but, from the immense speculations that had come to\nlight in making a bad end in America, and yet nearer home, it was known\nthat some Milton houses of business must suffer so severely that every\nday men's faces asked, if their tongues did not, 'What news? Who is\ngone? How will it affect me?' And if two or three spoke together, they\ndwelt rather on the names of those who were safe than dared to hint at\nthose likely, in their opinion, to go; for idle breath may, at such\ntimes, cause the downfall of some who might otherwise weather the storm;\nand one going down drags many after. 'Thornton is safe,' say they. 'His\nbusiness is large—extending every year; but such a head as he has, and\nso prudent with all his daring!' Then one man draws another aside, and\nwalks a little apart, and, with head inclined into his neighbour's ear,\nhe says, 'Thornton's business is large; but he has spent his profits in\nextending it; he has no capital laid by; his machinery is new within\nthese two years, and has cost him—we won't say what!—a word to the\nwise!' But that Mr. Harrison was a croaker,—a man who had succeeded to\nhis father's trade-made fortune, which he had feared to lose by altering\nhis mode of business to any having a larger scope; yet he grudged every\npenny made by others more daring and far-sighted."

Architect of his own fortunes, he attributed\nthis to no special merit or qualities of his own, but to the power,\nwhich he believed that commerce gave to every brave, honest, and\npersevering man, to raise himself to a level from which he might see and\nread the great game of worldly success, and honestly, by such\nfar-sightedness, command more power and influence than in any other mode\nof life. Far away, in the East and in the West, where his person would\nnever be known, his name was to be regarded, and his wishes to be\nfulfilled, and his word pass like gold. That was the idea of\nmerchant-life with which Mr. Thornton had started. 'Her merchants be\nlike princes,' said his mother, reading the text aloud, as if it were a\ntrumpet-call to invite her boy to the struggle. He was but like many\nothers—men, women, and children—alive to distant, and dead to near\nthings. He sought to possess the influence of a name in foreign\ncountries and far-away seas,—to become the head of a firm that should\nbe known for generations; and it had taken him long silent years to come\neven to a glimmering of what he might be now, to-day, here in his own\ntown, his own factory, among his own people. He and they had led\nparallel lives—very close, but never touching—till the accident (or so\nit seemed) of his acquaintance with Higgins. Once brought face to face,\nman to man, with an individual of the masses around him, and (take\nnotice) out of the character of master and workman, in the first\ninstance, they had each begun to recognise that 'we have all of us one\nhuman heart.' It was the fine point of the wedge; and until now, when\nthe apprehension of losing his connection with two or three of the\nworkmen whom he had so lately begun to know as men,—of having a plan or\ntwo, which were experiments lying very close to his heart, roughly\nnipped off without trial,—gave a new poignancy to the subtle fear that\ncame over him from time to time; until now, he had never recognised how\nmuch and how deep was the interest he had grown of late to feel in his\nposition as manufacturer, simply because it led him into such close\ncontact, and gave him the opportunity of so much power, among a race of\npeople strange, shrewd, ignorant; but, above all, full of character and\nstrong human feeling."

The strike a year and\na half ago,—or more, for it was now untimely wintry weather, in a late\nspring,—that strike, when he was young, and he now was old—had\nprevented his completing some of the large orders he had then on hand.\nHe had locked up a good deal of his capital in new and expensive\nmachinery, and he had also bought cotton largely, for the fulfilment of\nthese orders, taken under contract. That he had not been able to\ncomplete them, was owing in some degree to the utter want of skill on\nthe part of the Irish hands whom he had imported; much of their work was\ndamaged and unfit to be sent forth by a house which prided itself on\nturning out nothing but first-rate articles. For many months, the\nembarrassment caused by the strike had been an obstacle in Mr.\nThornton's way; and often, when his eye fell on Higgins, he could have\nspoken angrily to him without any present cause, just from feeling how\nserious was the injury that had arisen from this affair in which he was\nimplicated. But when he became conscious of this sudden, quick\nresentment, he resolved to curb it. It would not satisfy him to avoid\nHiggins; he must convince himself that he was master over his own anger,\nby being particularly careful to allow Higgins access to him, whenever\nthe strict rules of business, or Mr. Thornton's leisure permitted. And\nby-and-bye, he lost all sense of resentment in wonder how it was, or\ncould be, that two men like himself and Higgins, living by the same\ntrade, working in their different ways at the same object, could look\nupon each other's position and duties in so strangely different a way.\nAnd thence arose that intercourse, which though it might not have the\neffect of preventing all future clash of opinion and action, when the\noccasion arose, would, at any rate, enable both master and man to look\nupon each other with far more charity and sympathy, and bear with each\nother more patiently and kindly.

Then the bills became due for the\ncotton he had purchased; and money being scarce, he could only borrow at\nexorbitant interest, and yet he could not realise any of his property.\nBut he did not despair; he exerted himself day and night to foresee and\nto provide for all emergencies; he was as calm and gentle to the women\nin his home as ever; to the workmen in his mill he spoke not many words,\nbut they knew him by this time; and many a curt, decided answer was\nreceived by them rather with sympathy for the care they saw pressing\nupon him, than with the suppressed antagonism which had formerly been\nsmouldering, and ready for hard words and hard judgments on all\noccasions.
