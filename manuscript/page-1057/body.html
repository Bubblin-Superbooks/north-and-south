<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">late this
morning. Now I've got a little piece of news for you. What do you think
of an invitation to dinner? a morning call, literally in the dewy
morning. Why, I've had the Vicar here already, on his way to the school.
How much the desire of giving our hostess a teetotal lecture for the
benefit of the haymakers, had to do with his earliness, I don't know;
but here he was, when I came down just before nine; and we are asked to
dine there to-day.'</p><p>'But Edith expects me backâ€”I cannot go,' said Margaret, thankful to
have so good an excuse.</p><p>'Yes! I know; so I told him. I thought you would not want to go. Still
it is open, if you would like it.'</p><p>'Oh, no!' said Margaret. 'Let us keep to our plan. Let us start at
twelve. It is very good and kind of them; but indeed I could not go.'</p><p>'Very well. Don't fidget yourself, and I'll arrange it all.'</p></div> </div>
