when, I fear, you may be involved in whatever risk we have to bear.
Mother! hadn't you better go into the back rooms? I'm not sure whether
they may not have made their way from Pinner's Lane into the
stable-yard; but if not, you will be safer there than here. Go Jane!'

the others.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">'I stop here!' said his mother. 'Where you are, there I stay.' And
indeed, retreat into the back rooms was of no avail; the crowd had
surrounded the outbuildings at the rear, and were sending forth their
awful threatening roar behind. The servants retreated into the garrets,
with many a cry and shriek. Mr. Thornton smiled scornfully as he heard
them. He glanced at Margaret, standing all by herself at the window
nearest the factory.</p></div> </div>
