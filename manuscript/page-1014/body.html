 Oft as I dare to dwell once more,
 Still must I miss the friends so tried,
 Whom Death has severed from my side.

 But ever when true friendship binds,
 Spirit it is that spirit finds;
 In spirit then our bliss we found,
 In spirit yet to them I'm bound.'

when any one looked at her. Her last alarm was lest they should be too
