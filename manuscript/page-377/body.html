go on speaking of Miss Hale, John, if I've to be kind to her. When I'm

of her, and hear you talk of her, I hate her. I can see she's given
herself airs to you as well as if you'd told me out.'</p><p>'And if she has,' said he—and then he paused for a moment—then went

for her misunderstanding me and my position. I can laugh at it!'</p><p>'To be sure! and at her too, with her fine notions and haughty tosses!'</p></div> </div>
