<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>'What a perfect life you seem to live here! I have always felt rather
contemptuously towards the poets before, with their wishes, "Mine be a
cot beside a hill," and that sort of thing: but now I am afraid that the
truth is, I have been nothing better than a cockney. Just now I feel as
if twenty years' hard study of law would be amply rewarded by one year
of such an exquisite serene life as this—such skies!' looking up—'such
crimson and amber foliage, so perfectly motionless as that!' pointing to
some of the great forest trees which shut in the garden as if it were a
nest.</p><p>'You must please to remember that our skies are not always as deep a
blue as they are now. We have rain, and our leaves do fall, and get
sodden: though I think Helstone is about as perfect a place as any in
the world. Recollect how you rather scorned my description of it one
evening in Harley Street: "a village in a tale."'</p><p>'Scorned, Margaret! That is rather a hard word.'</p></div> </div>
