bumper to the success of his orders. By th' twenty-first, I reckon,
he'll be pottered in his brains how to get 'em done in time. Tell him,
there's seven hundred'll come marching into Marlborough Mills, the
morning after he gives the five per cent, and will help him through his
contract in no time. You'll have 'em all there. My master, Hamper. He's
one o' th' oud-fashioned sort. Ne'er meets a man bout an oath or a
curse; I should think he were going to die if he spoke me civil; but
arter all, his bark's waur than his bite, and yo' may tell him one o'
his turn-outs said so, if yo' like. Eh! but yo'll have a lot of prize
mill-owners at Thornton's! I should like to get speech o' them, when
they're a bit inclined to sit still after dinner, and could na run for
the life on 'em. I'd tell 'em my mind. I'd speak up again th' hard way
they're driving on us!'</p></div> </div>
