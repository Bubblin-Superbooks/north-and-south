<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">obeyed the men's orders
conveyed through the housekeeper, than went by my own judgment. At one
time, the beef was too large, at another the mutton was not fat enough.
I think they saw how careful I was to leave them free, and not to
intrude my own ideas upon them; so, one day, two or three of the men—my
friend Higgins among them—asked me if I would not come in and take a
snack. It was a very busy day, but I saw that the men would be hurt if,
after making the advance, I didn't meet them half-way, so I went in, and
I never made a better dinner in my life. I told them (my next neighbours
I mean, for I'm no speech-maker) how much I'd enjoyed it; and for some
time, whenever that especial dinner recurred in their dietary, I was
sure to be met by these men, with a "Master, there's hot-pot for dinner
to-day, win yo' come?" If they had not asked me, I would no more have
intruded on them than I'd have gone to the mess at the barracks without
invitation.'</p></div> </div>
