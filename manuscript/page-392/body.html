Did not many a one i' the Bible? Ay, and see visions too! Why, even my
father thinks a deal o' dreams! I tell yo' again, I saw yo' as plainly,
coming swiftly towards me, wi' yo'r hair blown back wi' the very
swiftness o' the motion, just like the way it grows, a little standing
off like; and the white shining dress on yo've getten to wear. Let me
come and see yo' in it. I want to see yo' and touch yo' as in very deed
yo' were in my dream.'</p><p>'My dear Bessy, it is quite a fancy of yours.'</p><p>'Fancy or no fancy,—yo've come, as I knew yo' would, when I saw yo'r
movement in my dream,—and when yo're here about me, I reckon I feel
easier in my mind, and comforted, just as a fire comforts one on a dree
day. Yo' said it were on th' twenty-first; please God, I'll come and see
yo'.'</p><p>'Oh Bessy! you may come and welcome; but don't talk so—it really makes
me sorry. It does indeed.'</p></div> </div>
