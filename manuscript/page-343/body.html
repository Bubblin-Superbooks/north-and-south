<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Sir John but two shot his
steward down, there where he stood, for just telling him that he'd
racked the tenants, and he'd racked the tenants till he could get no
more money off them than he could get skin off a flint.'</p><p>'Well, Dixon, I won't shoot you, and I'll try not to be cross again.'</p><p>'You never have. If I've said it at times, it has always been to myself,
just in private, by way of making a little agreeable conversation, for
there's no one here fit to talk to. And when you fire up, you're the
very image of Master Frederick. I could find in my heart to put you in a
passion any day, just to see his stormy look coming like a great cloud
over your face. But now you go out, Miss. I'll watch over missus; and as
for master, his books are company enough for him, if he should come in.'</p><p>'I will go,' said Margaret. She hung about Dixon for a minute or so, as
if afraid and irresolute; then suddenly kissing her, she went quickly
out of the room.</p></div> </div>
