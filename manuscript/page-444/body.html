no appeal for a temporary reprieve, showed that quick observer of human
nature that she thought it better that the whole truth should be told.</p><p>'Not the disease. We cannot touch the disease, with all our poor vaunted
skill. We can only delay its progress—alleviate the pain it causes. Be
a man, sir—a Christian. Have faith in the immortality of the soul,
which no pain, no mortal disease, can assail or touch!'</p><p>But all the reply he got, was in the choked words, 'You have never been
married, Dr. Donaldson; you do not know what it is,' and in the deep,
manly sobs, which went through the stillness of the night like heavy
pulses of agony. Margaret knelt by him, caressing him with tearful
caresses. No one, not even Dr. Donaldson, knew how the time went by. Mr.
Hale was the first to dare to speak of the necessities of the present
moment.</p></div> </div>
