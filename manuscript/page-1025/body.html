But I have a kindness for all Susans, for simple Susan's sake.'</p><p>'My little Susan was disappointed when I left without wishing her
goodbye; and it has been on my conscience ever since, that I gave her
pain which a little more exertion on my part might have prevented. But
it is a long way. Are you sure you will not be tired?'</p><p>'Quite sure. That is, if you don't walk so fast. You see, here there are
no views that can give one an excuse for stopping to take breath. You
would think it romantic to be walking with a person "fat and scant o'
breath" if I were Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. Have compassion on my
infirmities for his sake.'</p><p>'I will walk slower for your own sake. I like you twenty times better
than Hamlet.'</p><p>'On the principle that a living ass is better than a dead lion?'</p></div> </div>
