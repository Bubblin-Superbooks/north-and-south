<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">strange muffled, groaning voice, till I, for very fright,
stood quite still, and only begged him to tell me what he had heard. And
then, with his hand jerking, as if some one else moved it against his
will, he gave me a wicked newspaper to read, calling our Frederick a
"traitor of the blackest dye," "a base, ungrateful disgrace to his
profession." Oh! I cannot tell what bad words they did not use. I took
the paper in my hands as soon as I had read it—I tore it up to little
bits—I tore it—oh! I believe Margaret, I tore it with my teeth. I did
not cry. I could not. My cheeks were as hot as fire, and my very eyes
burnt in my head. I saw your father looking grave at me. I said it was a
lie, and so it was. Months after, this letter came, and you see what
provocation Frederick had. It was not for himself, or his own injuries,
he rebelled; but he would speak his mind to Captain Reid, and so it went
on from bad to worse; and you see, most of the sailors stuck by
Frederick.</p></div> </div>
