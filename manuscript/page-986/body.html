<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">from expressing her feelings.</p><p>The course of Margaret's day was this; a quiet hour or two before a late
breakfast; an unpunctual meal, lazily eaten by weary and half-awake
people, but yet at which, in all its dragged-out length, she was
expected to be present, because, directly afterwards, came a discussion
of plans, at which, although they none of them concerned her, she was
expected to give her sympathy, if she could not assist with her advice;
an endless number of notes to write, which Edith invariably left to her,
with many caressing compliments as to her eloquence du billet; a little
play with Sholto as he returned from his morning's walk; besides the
care of the children during the servants' dinner; a drive or callers;
and some dinner or morning engagement for her aunt and cousins, which
left Margaret free, it is true, but rather wearied with the inactivity
of the day, coming upon depressed spirits and delicate health.</p></div> </div>
