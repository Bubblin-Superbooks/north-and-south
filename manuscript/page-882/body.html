to-night; possessed by ill-humour at being detained so long from her;
irritated by the mention of some name, because he thought it belonged to

temper had annoyed her. She sat quite still, after the first momentary

who has met with an unexpected rebuff; they slowly dilated into
mournful, reproachful sadness; and then they fell, and she bent over her
work, and did not speak again.</p></div> </div>
