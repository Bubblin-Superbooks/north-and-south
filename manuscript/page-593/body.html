<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">around me,—folk who've had time to think on these things,—while
my time has had to be gi'en up to getting my bread. Well, I sees these
people. Their lives is pretty much open to me. They're real folk. They
don't believe i' the Bible,—not they. They may say they do, for form's
sake; but Lord, sir, d'ye think their first cry i' th' morning is, "What
shall I do to get hold on eternal life?" or "What shall I do to fill my
purse this blessed day? Where shall I go? What bargains shall I strike?"
The purse and the gold and the notes is real things; things as can be
felt and touched; them's realities; and eternal life is all a talk, very
fit for—I ax your pardon, sir; yo'r a parson out o' work, I believe.
Well! I'll never speak disrespectful of a man in the same fix as I'm in
mysel'. But I'll just ax yo another question, sir, and I dunnot want yo
to answer it, only to put in yo'r pipe, and smoke it, afore yo' go for
to set down us, who only believe in what we see, as fools and noddies.
If salvation,</p></div> </div>
