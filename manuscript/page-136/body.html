<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter Vi</h4><h3>Farewell</h3><pre class="  "><code>'Unwatch'd the garden bough shall sway,
 The tender blossom flutter down,
 Unloved that beech will gather brown,
 The maple burn itself away;

 Unloved, the sun-flower, shining fair,
 Ray round with flames her disk of seed,
 And many a rose-carnation feed
 With summer spice the humming air;</code></pre><hr class="section"><pre class="  "><code> Till from the garden and the wild
 A fresh association blow,
 And year by year the landscape grow
