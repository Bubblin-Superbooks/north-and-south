<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">to spite me, you see, my dear, because before
now I've helped old Mr. Leonards to give George a good rating, down in
Southampton. So I said, there were other families be thankful if they
could think they were earning an honest living as I knew, who had far
more cause to blush for their sons, and to far away from home. To which
he made answer, like the impudent chap he is, that he were in a
confidential situation, and if I knew of any young man who had been so
unfortunate as to lead vicious courses, and wanted to turn steady, he'd
have no objection to lend him his patronage. He, indeed! Why, he'd
corrupt a saint. I've not felt so bad myself for years as when I were
standing talking to him the other day. I could have cried to think I
couldn't spite him better, for he kept smiling in my face, as if he took
all my compliments for earnest; and I couldn't see that he minded what I
said in the least, while I was mad with all his speeches.'</p></div> </div>
