opening for a private tutor there.'</p><p>'A private tutor!' said Margaret, looking scornful: 'What in the world
do manufacturers want with the classics, or literature, or the
accomplishments of a gentleman?'</p><p>'Oh,' said her father, 'some of them really seem to be fine fellows,
conscious of their own deficiencies, which is more than many a man at
Oxford is. Some want resolutely to learn, though they have come to man's
estate. Some want their children to be better instructed than they
themselves have been. At any rate, there is an opening, as I have said,
for a private tutor. Mr. Bell has recommended me to a Mr. Thornton, a
tenant of his, and a very intelligent man, as far as I can judge from
his letters. And in Milton, Margaret, I shall find a busy life, if not a
happy one, and people and scenes so different that I shall never be
reminded of Helstone.'</p></div> </div>
