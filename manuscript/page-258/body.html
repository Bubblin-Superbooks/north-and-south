has risen to eminence in the country, from the character and progress of
its peculiar business, you might have cared to visit some of the places
where it is carried on; places unique in the kingdom, I am informed. If
Miss Hale changes her mind and condescends to be curious as to the

of spinning carried on in my son's mill. Every improvement of machinery

mother, who was taking leave of Mrs. Hale with rustling dignity.</p><p>'I think I should like to know all about them, if I were you,' replied
Margaret quietly.</p></div> </div>
