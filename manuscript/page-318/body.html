<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">happened in
Nuremberg only three or four years ago. A rich man there lived alone in
one of the immense mansions which were formerly both dwellings and
warehouses. It was reported that he had a child, but no one knew of it
for certain. For forty years this rumour kept rising and falling—never
utterly dying away. After his death it was found to be true. He had a
son—an overgrown man with the unexercised intellect of a child, whom he
had kept up in that strange way, in order to save him from temptation
and error. But, of course, when this great old child was turned loose
into the world, every bad counsellor had power over him. He did not know
good from evil. His father had made the blunder of bringing him up in
ignorance and taking it for innocence; and after fourteen months of
riotous living, the city authorities had to take charge of him, in order
to save him from starvation. He could not even use words effectively
enough to be a successful beggar.'</p></div> </div>
