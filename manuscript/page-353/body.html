take up John Boucher's cause, as lives next door but one, wi' a sickly
wife, and eight childer, none on 'em factory age; and I don't take up
his cause only, though he's a poor good-for-nought, as can only manage
two looms at a time, but I take up th' cause o' justice. Why are we to

arbitrary decision of theirs, come to without reason.'</p><p>'Yo're just a foreigner, and nothing more,' said he, contemptuously.
'Much yo' know about it. Ask th' masters! They'd tell us to mind our own
business, and they'd mind theirs. Our business being, yo' understand, to
take the bated' wage, and be thankful, and their business to bate us
down to clemming point, to swell their profits. That's what it is.'</p></div> </div>
