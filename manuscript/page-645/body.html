hear a quotation once more, however languidly given.</p><p>'Dear old Dixon! How we shall kiss each other!' said Frederick. 'She
used to kiss me, and then look in my face to be sure I was the right

fire. I'll manage it. Lighting fires is one of my natural
accomplishments.'</p><p>So Margaret went away; and returned; and passed in and out of the room,
in a glad restlessness that could not be satisfied with sitting still.

mourning, and the zest of it was all the more pungent, because they knew
in the depths of their hearts what irremediable sorrow awaited them.</p></div> </div>
