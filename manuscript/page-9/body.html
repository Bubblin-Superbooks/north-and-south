volume form in 1855.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">On its appearance in 'Household Words,' this tale was obliged to conform
to the conditions imposed by the requirements of a weekly publication,
and likewise to confine itself within certain advertised limits, in
order that faith might be kept with the public. Although these
conditions were made as light as they well could be, the author found it
impossible to develope the story in the manner originally intended, and,
more especially, was compelled to hurry on events</p></div> </div>
