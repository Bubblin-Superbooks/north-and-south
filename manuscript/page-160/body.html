fairly in contact with the taste that loves ornament, however bad, more
than the plainness and simplicity which are of themselves the framework
of elegance. Her father took her through the entrance of the hotel, and
leaving her at the foot of the staircase, went to the address of the

waiter:</p><p>'I beg your pardon, ma'am. The gentleman was gone so quickly, I had no
time to tell him. Mr. Thornton called almost directly after you left;
and, as I understood from what the gentleman said, you would be back in
an hour, I told him so, and he came again about five minutes ago, and
said he would wait for Mr. Hale. He is in your room now, ma'am.'</p></div> </div>
