children and young people are the happiest under the unfailing laws of a
discreet, firm authority. I agree with Miss Hale so far as to consider
our people in the condition of children, while I deny that we, the
masters, have anything to do with the making or keeping them so. I
maintain that despotism is the best kind of government for them; so that
in the hours in which I come in contact with them I must necessarily be
an autocrat. I will use my best discretion—from no humbug or
philanthropic feeling, of which we have had rather too much in the
North—to make wise laws and come to just decisions in the conduct of my
business—laws and decisions which work for my own good in the first
instance—for theirs in the second; but I will neither be forced to give
my reasons, nor flinch from what I have once declared to be my
resolution. Let them turn out! I shall suffer as well as they: but at
the end</p></div> </div>
