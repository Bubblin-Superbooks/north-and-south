It was but an unsatisfactory visit to Mrs. Boucher; she considered
herself as an ill-used woman by her poor husband's suicide; and there
was quite germ of truth enough in this idea to make it a very difficult

selfishness extended even to her relations with her children, whom she
considered as incumbrances, even in the very midst of her somewhat
animal affection for them. Margaret tried to make acquaintances with one
or two of them, while her father strove to raise the widow's thoughts
into some higher channel than that of mere helpless querulousness. She
found that the children were truer and simpler mourners than the widow.

stammering way, of some tenderness shown some indulgence granted by the
lost father.</p></div> </div>
