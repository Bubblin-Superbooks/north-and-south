Margaret's trick of calling her 'dear old Dixon' whenever she was
particularly demonstrative. She knew that Miss Hale was apt to call all
people that she liked 'old,' as a sort of term of endearment; but Dixon
always winced away from the application of the word to herself, who,
being not much past fifty, was, she thought, in the very prime of life.
Secondly, she did not like being so easily taken at her word; she had,
with all her terror, a lurking curiosity about Spain, the Inquisition,
and Popish mysteries. So, after clearing her throat, as if to show her
willingness to do away with difficulties, she asked Miss Hale, whether
she thought if she took care never to see a priest, or enter into one of
their churches, there would be so very much danger of her being
converted? Master Frederick,</p></div> </div>
