the thing she liked to repeat.</p><p>'Sarah what?' asked Fanny, sharply. 'Don't speak in these half
sentences, or I can't understand you.'</p><p>'Well, miss, since you will have it—Sarah, you see, was in the best
place for seeing, being at the right-hand window; and she says, and said
at the very time too, that she saw Miss Hale with her arms about
master's neck, hugging him before all the people.'</p><p>'I don't believe it,' said Fanny. 'I know she cares for my brother; any
one can see that; and I dare say, she'd give her eyes if he'd marry
her,—which he never will, I can tell her. But I don't believe she'd be
so bold and forward as to put her arms round his neck.'</p><p>'Poor young lady! she's paid for it dearly if she did. It's my belief,
that the blow has given her such an ascendency of blood to the head as
she'll never get the better from. She looks like a corpse now.'</p></div> </div>
