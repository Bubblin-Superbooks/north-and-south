<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">have lived there all their lives, are
used to soaking in the stagnant waters. They labour on, from day to day,
in the great solitude of steaming fields—never speaking or lifting up
their poor, bent, downcast heads. The hard spade-work robs their brain
of life; the sameness of their toil deadens their imagination; they
don't care to meet to talk over thoughts and speculations, even of the
weakest, wildest kind, after their work is done; they go home brutishly
tired, poor creatures! caring for nothing but food and rest. You could
not stir them up into any companionship, which you get in a town as
plentiful as the air you breathe, whether it be good or bad—and that I
don't know; but I do know, that you of all men are not one to bear a
life among such labourers. What would be peace to them would be eternal
fretting to you. Think no more of it, Nicholas, I beg. Besides, you
could never pay to get mother and children all there—that's one good
thing.'</p></div> </div>
