quietly.</p><p>'I shall like to see her. She must be an uncommon person,' her mother
added.</p><p>'Perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us, and be glad of our

fancy Mrs. Thornton is as haughty and proud in her way, as our little
Margaret here is in hers, and that she completely ignores that old time
of trial, and poverty, and economy, of which he speaks so openly. I am
