rather than of driving up to a London church in the middle of a paved
street.'</p><p>'Tell me about Helstone. You have never described it to me. I should
like to have some idea of the place you will be living in, when
ninety-six Harley Street will be looking dingy and dirty, and dull, and

There is the church and a few houses near it on the green—cottages,
rather—with roses growing all over them.'</p><p>'And flowering all the year round, especially at Christmas—make your
picture complete,' said he.</p><p>'No,' replied Margaret, somewhat annoyed, 'I am not making a picture. I
am trying to describe Helstone as it really is. You should not have said
that.'</p></div> </div>
