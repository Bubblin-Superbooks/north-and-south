irritating him, 'the state of trade may be such as not to enable them to
give you the same remuneration.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">'State o' trade! That's just a piece o' masters' humbug. It's rate o'
wages I was talking of. Th' masters keep th' state o' trade in their own
hands; and just walk it forward like a black bug-a-boo, to frighten
naughty children with into being good. I'll tell yo' it's their
part,—their cue, as some folks call it,—to beat us down, to swell
their fortunes; and it's ours to stand up and fight hard,—not for
ourselves alone, but for them round about us—for justice and fair play.
We help to make their profits, and we ought to help spend 'em. It's not
that we want their brass so much this time, as we've done many a time
afore. We'n getten money laid by; and we're resolved to stand and fall
together; not a man on us will go in for less wage than th' Union says
is our due.</p></div> </div>
