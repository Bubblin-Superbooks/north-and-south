not the place for cowards. I have known the time when I have had to
thread my way through a crowd of white, angry men, all swearing they
would have Makinson's blood as soon as he ventured to show his nose out
of his factory; and he, knowing nothing of it, some one had to go and
tell him, or he was a dead man, and it needed to be a woman,â€”so I went.
And when I had got in, I could not get out. It was as much as my life
was worth. So I went up to the roof, where there were stones piled ready
to drop on the heads of the crowd, if they tried to force the factory
doors. And I would have lifted those heavy stones, and dropped them with
as good an aim as the best man there, but that I fainted with the heat I
had gone</p></div> </div>
