Margaret went along, without noticing anything very different from usual
in the first mile and a half of her journey; she was absorbed in her own

at ease, she had got into Marlborough Street before the full conviction
forced itself upon her, that there was a restless, oppressive sense of
irritation abroad among the people;</p></div> </div>
