as he returned Margaret's to her, and held out his hand for Mr.
Lennox's, which was withheld from him one moment, no more.</p><p>'No, papa! I don't think I have. The house-leek and stone-crop have
grown so much darker in the rain. Is it not like, papa?' said she,
peeping over his shoulder, as he looked at the figures in Mr. Lennox's
drawing.</p><p>'Yes, very like. Your figure and way of holding yourself is capital. And
it is just poor old Isaac's stiff way of stooping his long rheumatic
back. What is this hanging from the branch of the tree? Not a bird's
nest, surely.'</p><p>'Oh no! that is my bonnet. I never can draw with my bonnet on; it makes
my head so hot. I wonder if I could manage figures. There are so many
people about here whom I should like to sketch.'</p></div> </div>
